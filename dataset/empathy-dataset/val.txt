Talk with your teachers, ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things. Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job! I'll be rooting for you.;strong
glad you found something to help even if just a little;weak
You aren't too much they are just assholes for leaving you. its horrible for them to just leave you when you are struggling because they don't feel like being supportive. You will find friends who care. Sometimes friends come out and tell you that you can talk to them about anything you just need to find the right people.;weak
you ever done opiates before?;no
way to go. keep it up champ!;weak
Just let it out then, that's what this is place is for. Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :);strong
listen to the song people=shit by slipknot....it might release some of the tension you're feeling right now. there are a couple of good things in life, maybe some really bomb food you love to eat or a show you really like or something, anything small that makes you feel better keep doing it;weak
Good idea. Don't let people treat you like shit and step all over you. You don't need people like that in your life. I'm still kinda passive but I've been trying to have more respect for myself.;weak

That's hard. Especially if you're the type of person to post in this sub. Loving yourself is really difficult. But loving others is easier. And I do love you. When you love others, I find, its easier to love yourself. Even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good. I hope I helped.;strong
Is that really so bad? Maybe it was the smart decision because you needed that time to read recover. You're being kind to yourself when you need it and that's important. Hope you feel better soon.;weak
What help are you looking for;no
Hey man, I seen that you need to vent. Im all ears and you can tell me anything. Just shoot me a PM;weak
I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good. I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points. And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto. I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot. Pm me if you ever wanna chat about whatever. Your energy doesn't affect mine.;strong
One thing at a time, get up, shower. Even if that's all you get done, it's the first step you have to take.;no
Yep. All of a sudden the place you call home is stealing every bit of oxygen from you. A place where I took my day off has suddenly turned into a hellhole filled with triggers and layers of depression. Get me out of here;no
I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. A person can be cared for by dozens and still feel alone, depression is a monster. I hope you're able to make progress against it in your own way, or by talking to people you trust, living the life you want to live, or by obtaining professional help. Please send me a message if you would like to talk to someone privately.;strong
Remember this. In order to find light, you must be surrounded by darkness. Whatever you're going through, remember that you can overcome it!;weak
Happy birthday, anyway. Maybe by next year you'll want to be alive.;no
Well now people want photographic evidence :[ You probably look fine though;weak
Yes it can be. I feel the exact same.;weak
I feel the same. I do my best to push through every day and hope tomorrow will be better and it never is. Please don't do it. If I'm still here, you better stay too.;weak
I am sorry. I don't know what to say.;strong
"Just do it. Don't think about it. Everything will be fine. &amp;#x200B;";weak
sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?;strong
Hang in there bro shit happens, I'm going through some similar times right now but it's okay, try to find something to take your mind off them it will help a bunch I'm always down to chat if you want send me a dm.;weak
I didn't talk for a year and a half when I was small. I couldn't talk as I was threatened if I did then very bad things would happen. I remember it very well. It was so difficult. I'm sorry you are feeling the way you are now. I'm here if you want to talk. Please take care.;strong
Please don't cut yourself. You can post more about your situation, I'm sure there are always people in this sub that will offer a listening ear. I would.;weak
if this isn't a mood...;no
I'm so sorry you're going through this.. My dog passed away two months ago so I know how painful it is :( I adopted another dog, I was still upset but it definitely helped me with the grieving process.;strong
Sorry you are feeling that way but How do you know it was a lie? In My experience most people don't compliment unless they meant it. Excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course. Who complimented you and in what context?;strong
Currently? No. But 12 days ago I drank until I blacked out just trying to forget my feelings and forget everything until morning. My subconscious, drunk brain had other plans. I tried to hang myself from a bridge but luckily was too drunk to execute it. I ended up with broken bones in both my feet, a required 5 day stay in a hospital behavior and addiction unit, and no memory of what I had done or even ever feeling suicidal. 12 days sober and have accepted that I have a binge drinking problem. You can only drown your sorrows for so long before they explode outward - one way or another. I am happy to help any way I can.;weak
There are much worse things out there, at least nitrous oxide is safe in reasonable amounts. No need to feel low about it, it hurt you and not addictive. Enjoy it while you can and move on. :);weak
so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.;strong
Good morning bro, im happy that you woke up and read this comment! I hope you have a great day today!;strong
I'm so sorry. Are u ok;strong
I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR;no
Yes, a know how the fuck you survived that but so fucking strong have an anxiety endured award;weak
What DO you love? Is there something you are passionate about? Something (other than another person, as people are inconstant and often unreliable) that you are passionate about? Self destruction takes a lot of energy. If you can refocus it on creation (of almost anything other than say, slashes on your wrists) it might help you. This is how I have found peace. When I feel the monster stirring I write it poetry and kiss it goodnight. I hope the best for you.;weak
me too i dont care about studying or getting a job all i want to do is just ride my bike all day and play basketball. i hate being home and criticized or judged for being slim and other stupid bullshit;no
Maybe she just didn't know how to react to it... or just in shock. i think you should see a therapist because it seems that you're a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts. There's more to life than people's validation about you, trust me. It really gets better overtime. Bad thoughts will come and it will pass, you need to find support of others to overcome it.;weak
I'm really sorry for this. I'm going through something similar and I have pretty much given up all hope that I am the same as my peers. I am definitely not. I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill. After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time.;strong
I feel the same way. At least I did for a while. I talked to my doctor a couple years ago and basically I learned that depression is a *mental illness* and you can literally have no reason to be depressed, like myself, and still feel like absolute shit and want to cry all the time. I'm pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it. I myself am still trying to fight it but It's only been maybe like 8 years so I'm sure it will get better eventually. Just stay strong my dude. If you ever need anyone talk to you can PM me. I stay up all hours of the night on the east coast.;weak
Sorry you are feeling that way but How do you know it was a lie? In My experience most people don't compliment unless they meant it. Excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course. Who complimented you and in what context?;strong
From what read only if an immidiate threat to yourself they will trace your call and call the cops. quote me on that though as not 100% certain.;no
I have to kickstart my ass into getting out of the house. Go to a museum, arboretum, take a walk somewhere. Once I get going, it's okay for a few hours. But that only works when I don't wake up and start drinking. Sometimes when I come back home it's the same old despair all over again.;no
Test mean literllery nothing. in like 3 years you proballey wont even remember that test;weak
Your foundation needs to fall down before you can start rebuilding. Have you started the plans the blueprint? List everything on a paper or make a note in your head what you need to do to make things better. I'm still rebuilding right now. But I don't have this dark ugly building that overshadowed me. Now I can start thinking what the fuck I need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way I want it. It'll take time but it's all worth it. Allow yourself to rebuild.;weak
Me too, that's why I treat everyone like shit. I'm hoping that one day nobody cares about me, even my parents. That day is the day I'll become free from my despair;no
Ya a few weeks ago my manager at work made a rude comment to me. She does this all the time and it wasn't even that big of a deal but I was depressed for like 3 days. I went home that night and legitimately wanted to die. Sometimes it's just the straw that broke the camels back yknow.;weak
Everyone wants to forget something. But most of the time, we can't. Memories make us human. Good memories, bad memories, they really shouldn't make a difference now. That's the past. Try and focus on the present and the future. Even if you create bad memories, try and overcome them with positive, lovely and beautiful ones. I've been through this, and still am going through it, but I find it calming to talk to someone I love and care about. Maybe that could help you too!;no
quite a few things ive noticed for myself. ill over simplify my thought process to get the point across. Ill list them quickly. I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game. If life was beating me up, maybe if I did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad. since moved on from this. These mindsets were unhealthy for me but recognizing them was essential to my own recovery.;no
Meds effect everyone differently. Call your doctor. It might be bc of the meds or maybe you'd feel this way now anyway. SSRIs for me really help with anxiety but not at all for depression. Everyone is different.;no
I'm around if you need someone to chat with. I'm sorry you're feeling sad. Sometimes it's such a painful and unbearable feeling.;strong
I'm so sorry you feel that pain. I know that pain all too well. That's amazing that you went so long without it! I can hardly manage three months, and I've been doing it for years. It's hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to. You are fine. People slip up here and there.;strong
I've noticed it helps me a lot to go outside during the day, so that I can feel the sun (if there's any) and so I can smell fresh air.;no
Yep I do the same thing myself.;no
You're a good man, Median. I hope you know this. I hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries, and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations. But, I'd rather you live, personally.;weak
**hugs if you want them**;strong
I'm sorry that you're also in this position. I'm honestly just waiting for my parents to die so I can kill myself.;strong
Average is great! At least you don't suck.;weak
"All day, every day. It's definitely not just you. &lt;3";weak
Trust your intuition. 99% of my friends treated me like garbage and when I got away from them and built my self-confidence up I did things I never thought I would manage.;no
I'm sorry that haopened. I've never had a breakup because I always get rejected. I've had similar things so I can at least get an idea of how that must feel. But I believe you can find another girl you live.;strong
Really depends on the particular medication. Everyone responds differently as well. I have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants, but I am not a good example. I know people who really improved while being on them. It is a bit of a gamble and it can take time to find the suitable med for you. I would say it is worth a try though.;no
I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!;weak
Saw mine coming a mile away. Suffering from anxiety and depression, and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult. Job was going to shit and stressing me out. Money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home. Was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night. One day it became too much. Started crying and having a panic attack. Didn't stop until I drank myself to sleep. The next day I was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed. That was three years ago;no
Good luck friend I wish you the best. There have been multiple times where I wondered if this was a good idea for me, but I have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless I were married or something. Lol. Anyway, know you are brave and I am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself. You deserve to get better and I believe in you!;weak
8 years of very severe, suicidal depression, I feel you, mate. I'm incredibly sorry.;strong
Yea. Especially since I regularly have lucid dreams. It's amazing, except when you wake up with a bitter taste in your mouth.;no
Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe. I went out of it over two and a half years, and I hadn't ever known about these kinds of things until I was 19. Just trying to say it can be done man. Love you;strong
*hug* I can't remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either, I need a hug or a cuddle so bad, the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me. I feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time. I don't know how long I can go on. Best of luck!;strong
Cocaine keeps accidentally falling into my nose. That pesky cocaine.;no
Yess I feel you, and I guess being depressed is bad for you as well so you're just trading one bad thing for another, except this one makes you happy. So yeah basically why I do it;weak
this will probably not help you but i had a very long depression i was unable to do the most simple tasks, sleeping in my own trash, i lacked the energy to clean my god damn place how much more useless could i become? Sounds funny but its true, hurting my self, crying to sleep, no friends and honestly looking back i was a complete waste of space better off to have my brains blown the fuck out. But that doesnt mean we dont have the potential to completely change things around. This was me 2 years ago for a solid decade i was barely hanging on and now ive changed everything around and i do not suffer from daily suicidal thoughts, self harm and long depressing episodes.;no
I know you mean well, but this really help a large majority of people with depression. Plenty of people afford professional help, or it work for them. Some people, myself included, make any friends at all. The negativity, among other things, that comes with this illness is like a poisonous cloud that brings other people down with you and ultimately pushes them away.;weak
I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise.;strong
Just another day to throw away. Typically with an extra helping of faked emotions and facial expressions to keep my friends and family under the impression that I'm okay on that day, when it's the day I wish didn't happen. It's fucking exhausting;no
Not Hollywood per se, but Ned Vizzini suicide hit me hard. now live for real, Craig. Live. Live. Live. I feel many similarities between him and me (same age, etc). A successful author but this disease is just too much sometimes.;no
I guess kind of our fault, but at the same time I think we desperately wish we could be better. Sometimes we really physically and emotionally can not be better. Stay strong, not alone.;weak
Can you open-up a bit to explain? What's the matter? Go on, if it's alright with you.;no
Why not try and get to know some of us? May help short term.;no
I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better.;strong
Once you are at the bottom you can only go up. Hope things get better for you :);weak
Anything can happen in 2017. Happy new year to you and I hope this one won't be a waste;weak
I'm sorry. I hope you get a good day soon.;strong
sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :);strong
Depression is hell. I feel ya.;weak
I think I can only live if I keep myself happy. If I relax, the nightmares come ... :(;no
You do not need a reason to be depressed and there is no reason to feel guilty for being depressed for no reason.;no
Great Work!!! Wanted to tell you I too am proud of you. I saw someone as well after a last year. I am very proud of you and ever think there is anything wrong with seeing someone!;strong
Uhhh... who? Sorry I can't help you very much...;strong
Being alone is terrible. I'm sorry you're alone. If I hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there, then I suggest doing just about anything different. Anything, really. Break your horrible, lonely routine. The only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change. What can you do differently tomorrow?;strong
I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise.;strong
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?;strong
I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain.;strong
so sorry hurting so much. here.;strong
Please be safe and seek help. I have been really depressed and lonely before where I tried what you tried. I took over 20+ pills trying to OD to end up at the doctors with them believing it was a virus. I also tried cutting but I was too scared of the pain. I lived through the loneliness and pain only to be depressed again, but I came to a realization- I deserve better and I am worth it. It's definitely hard and a battle everyday, but with professional help, I am getting better day by day. You deserve better and you are worth it. Please stay strong and I do hope you talk to someone to get the help you need.;weak
Depends. If you are a girl it could be your monthly breakdown.;no
Hmu if you want to talk.;weak
What's going on at the moment that is making you so upset?;no
Just fucking do it. what could go wrong. Make your life about being grateful for everything and you will not be disappointed. Stay busy. don't let yourself get lost in anything but her. make loving her your first and for most job and you will never be disappointed or sad.;weak
IT is a sector in boom right now. There are tons of jobs and its only growing. You will have no problem finding a job whatsoever, however i understand your worry is money. Even after you get a job, keep looking, and applying. The more experience you have the better. You can probably find jobs that pay higher and higher. Idk how far youre in right now through your course, but if it's not too late, try taking some security courses as well. While IT is in a boom, having security courses on your resume would almost guarantee that you will always have a job. Literally every company needs help with security, and they're will to pay lots of money to find it. Everything will be fine.;weak
You could always leave them and find your own indipendence, sorrounding yourself with the people you love which are not part of your family. Idk your situation actually, but I felt the same way too many times, so lonely and neglected by the ones that should care the most. It happens, but this perception is not necessary the truth. Killing yourself won't solve or change anything.;weak
There are people, who want to know more if you don't fake it.. but some people are not worth knowing your secrets.. so just don't mind them, smile and move on. However, it can become stressful if you have nobody to talk to in a realistic way as possible without anything fake at all on you. With people, where you can toss that mask away for a moment and just be that negative little cunt for a moment lol.. we all need it sometimes.;weak
It's not immature to have suicidal thoughts but it is, however, unfair that you were judged for it. Some people just don't understand how something feels until they experience it themselves. I was always told that my suicidal tendencies were not only annoying, but they were also bullshit. It took me a while to accept that it's not wrong to reach out and want someone to care and help you.;weak
Sometimes it does feel like people suck, but with billions of them around, there's bound to be a *lot* of good ones.;no
I like to do healthy or productive hobbies when I feel like that. Sometimes it's all I look forward to in my day and it helps pull me through one day at a time. I think talking to others will help a lot too. If you wanna chat you can PM me.;weak
"Often times people take laughter as a cue that what doing is okay. I do the same thing whenever someone picks on me, even though it hurts inside for all of us. let other opinions influence how you see yourself, as hard as that can be. &lt;3";weak
thanks, friend. do the same for you.;weak
i feel very much like you. id like to give you advice but im just as broken so ill just let you know that i feel with you here. maybe that will help.;weak
Wait, you got fired due your depression? Where are you from? Isn't depression classified as a medical condition like any other? Aren't you protected by law against such action? Sorry to read about your situation. And sorry for all the questions. Guilty of being a lawyer :/;strong
I hate myself too but I have a reason I got into some stupid shit that ended up ruining my life. I have fucked up siblings that aided in this but in the end I only have myself to blame;no
Hi there. I'm not often online, and when online it's erratic and random, but I can give it a go if you want. Hugs, and hope things become better for you soon! :);strong
Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions. What emotion are you experiencing right now? How do you identify it? What caused you to feel like this? What steps can you make to prevent this feeling? Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future.;strong
I feel you there and I am so sorry! Those people suck!;strong
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?;strong
Sorry to hear. I hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again.;strong
Ah I'm sorry :( Panic attack are awful but you certainly shouldn't feel embarrassed!;strong
Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend.;weak
You can't fix everything because that's impossible. No one would expect you to fix everything. You're only human ya know;weak
Hey its okay man. Life sucks dick, just keep pushing through.;weak
Wait, does this mean you're seeing someone already? I can see the concern, but if you're already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isn't really better. You can always look for a second opinion. I'm getting help, but before I was (and while I was trying to find the right combo of things), I'd have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently. Like, 4-5 days out of a week. It sucked hard. Right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time, but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week. Sometimes I make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself, even if it's not actually enjoyable. This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern.;weak
really sorry going through this. basically going through the same thing right now. Let me know if you ever wanna chat. Things will get better eventually, I hope.;strong
Sorry, it's hard. I hated it.;weak
This is so me, I have social anxiety ocd and anxiety and depression too. 20 and feel the exact same way.;no
I always wanted to die in my dreams because I'd like to believe I'd get to stay in them. Probably wouldn't happen that way.;no
"It's okay not to be okay. A lot of us in this sub are in the same boat as you. You are not alone &lt;3";weak
For what worth it probably mean much coming from a complete stranger but glad it failed, or the world would have just lost 1 more good person and we are low on them as is You can pm me anytime if you wanna talk;strong
I feel like a pro would be validation. When a psychiatrist told me that yes, I do have anxiety, it really helped me to feel like I wasn't just over reacting you know? Another pro would be future doctors that you see understanding your diagnoses. I can't really think of an con to be honest. It's also possible that whoever is prescribing your medication has diagnosed you already. I would ask!;no
Yea. Sorry. I know how you feel. feeling very alone today.;strong
"You writing this &amp; still being here I think that's a good sign,I think it means that deep down there's still hope that things will get better &amp; you'll start feeling happier &amp; less lonely, hold on to that feeling &amp; if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me.";weak
I'm sorry for however long you still have to deal with them, but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to, and that is 100% okay. You are your own very awesome person and they don't get a say in who you are.;strong
I'm sorry man. I wish I could take the pain away.;strong
what life path are you;no
"At least it's something. Would you rather have them pity you or not give a shit? I feel alone with everyone I'm around. I think it'd be worse knowing I'm truly alone. Embrace it because they love you regardless how you are as a person. (How's that for not wanting to be pitied? ;) )";no
What I'm trying to say is that routine is significantly important, and the first thing many clinical psychologists ask is if you have a job (basically makes you set up a routine) And routines make you less likely to develop depression if they are balanced and will make your enjoyment of life increase as well;no
I know exactly how you feel. just one day of many though. Take it one hour, one minute at a time. Think about some self care you can do for yourself once you get home. having one of those days too but try not to let the depression get too deep. Fight it. Plan for a nice bath at home, or make/pick up your favorite meal on your way home. You are a wonderful human being and you deserve happiness. Just get through today. Tomorrow will be another opportunity for something better. Feel free to PM me if you want someone to vent to to pass the time.;weak
A lot of people turn to drinking alcohol to escape from feeling shit, to feel better or feel like nothing matters, the first 2 maybe 3 drinks kind of gives us a 'who cares' attitude, but when we keep drinking, it does make us feel more vulnerable and fragile, making us emotionally worse, Ive done this many times. What do you like doing? what do you like spendin your time on? movies? tv? games? being creative? could be anything, what is yours?;no
I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better.;strong
I'm so sorry. Are u ok;strong
I'll be thinking this all night tonight.;no
Because there'll be better days. I know you what you think. That it's bs but it's true. I've fallen so hard yet sooner or later there's that one thing happening and then it gets better. If you off yourself now think about all the things you couldn't expirience? Your first kiss, playing with your child, true love, a beautiful landscape that you maybe planned on visiting, the smell of rain, the taste of your favorite food, that awesome feeling of completing a task and it goes on and on. I know how you feel. I didnt believe it either but it's true. It may take years to come but there'll be a moment later where'll you say im happy that i didnt kill myself;weak
I feel you there and I am so sorry! Those people suck!;strong
Just do the best you can in life :));no
You are not alone. Just remember that.;weak
As you get older you might be glad to find them not remembered. I think it's important to not rely on external validation (easy to say right?) but also to provide that support to others. Let's say you try to make to recognise the birthday or other significant event for at least two other people you know this year.... I don't know if that will help.;weak
Yeah I often wonder if I am just negative/ungrateful/lazy/etc or if there really is a legit label for it. Constant battle in my head.;no
Same here, friend. What's your favourite Zeppelin song or album?;no
Please don't. Its just not right choice make. There is always something that can be done other than that.;strong
Talk with your teachers, ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things. Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job! I'll be rooting for you.;strong
Well, get up, have a shower and do something productive with your day. Finish that book you've always wanted to. Watch that movie you've been waiting to see. Make yourself an amazing dinner or better yet, make some cookies for your workmates. Go visit an animal shelter. Get outside for a walk. Everyone has days where they don't want to human. It's up to you though, if you are wanting to try. Xoxo;no
You can't fix everything because that's impossible. No one would expect you to fix everything. You're only human ya know;weak
What were you taking before vs what are you taking now? Are you being prescribed by your general doctor or a psychiatrist? Do you feel like you are in danger right now?;no
