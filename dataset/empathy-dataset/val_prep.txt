im game and need to vent so here goes i was verbally physically and emotionally abused for as long as i can recall since you asked about emotional abuse i will focus solely on that i was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family my mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me i was constantly told if you had a brain you would be dangerous by my mother not after id done anything not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing this was my mothers assesment of me and she told me this frequently i was tested determined to have a high iq placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic superficial egotistical mother for my entire life if i vot an a i was told it was because the work was too easy for me if i got a b it was because i was lazy and never applied myself i would constantly be accused of thinking i was so smart nothing i ever did or attempted to do was good enough there was always some flaw in it i only received criticism never any praise in 4th grade i had lovely long hair my mother decided i should have it all cut off she took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off a boy cut they shaved the back of my neck my mom cried afterward and said she was crying because the haircut showed how ugly i was the next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room my mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car she said i dont want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter my mother really values externak beauty i was a skinny unremarlable child i never forgot the other side of the street incident i had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until i moved away from home and got married at age 19 every time i saw it i thought of that day years of torture i was a divorced single mother my ex never paid a dime not any of the support we were supposed to receive i worked two jobs to support us i never received any financial help from anyone i crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person i never drank never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble but my mother wasis ashamed of me and mademakes sure to let me know it anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are my mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how id turned out how she always thought id be someone when i grew up she said shed hoped i wouldve grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important i told her i was someone at the time i was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother i was an embarrassment a nothing and a nobody my mothers father my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me he treated me like i was special and had value my mother knew i adored him and she hated that he liked me after he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather i worshipped really was and that i should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most right after i was divorced i was not yet employed full time and very poor i was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country my mother started bitching about how poor i was i had not asked her or dad for a dime and i was not there to eat mom started talking about dying asked me if i had a sill etc mom told me i better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway she also told me that shed always thought of me as a living abortion since my birth she was going nuts yelling and spitting she told me she bet i was so poor such a failure that i probably could not even afford feminine products i got my purse to leave opened it and hurled a few tampons at her as i told her wrong bitch my father blocked the front door and tried to make me apologise to my mother i had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go after my father passed away my mother called she said she needed to ask me something then mom said did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you i told my mom that yes yes i did that dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative i thought he did love and care about me he has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when i was young that there had been a few occassions that hed been very nice to me like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew i wanted for my 16th birthday buying me a computer working with me on computer projects early on buying us both laptops teaching me to shoot and fish and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me etc i told mom that was how dad expressed his love my mother said thats interesting because i always had the impression that he didnt care about you at all i was also emotionally abused by my father it was different than my mothers abuse though my dad alwsys had to be the best he could not stand for me to be good at anything i could never ever be as good as he was or god fobid it better my parents were never involved in our education they basically just asked us at dinner how school was and wed say ok and dinner would proceed i should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day i was happy and excited about something that had happened at school in english class i was so excited that i stupidly spoke up at dinner when the standard how was school question was asked i boldly said school was great mrs g my english teacher pulled me aside after class she told me a poem id written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook my father put his fork down he tilted his head gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem i could not recite it i was too nervous and afraid i said i would show it to him after dinner it was no big deal no dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem i had written right then i went and got the poem and started to read it out loud dad told me to give it to him to read he told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing he said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return after about twenty minutes dad cheerfully returned poem in hand he stood and read it to us it was some lame poem with brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines dad then told us see thats a poem thats what good poetry is like after that he asked all of us wasnt my poem better a lot better we all agreed and lied and said his poem was a lot better i told the english teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook i never wrote another poem or much else for that matter that crap happened in 1975 and i am still not over it despite counseling another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy my father came first then my sister or mother then me ialways came last even though i was the eldest child there was this thing with the food if we had any serving size type of meat it came into play lets say it is steaks for dinner they are on a platter the largest steak is for dad younger sister gets the next largest mom third largest and smallest was for me it was like that with all of the food it was an unwritten rule i decided to challenge it once when the platter of hamburgers was beside me i knew better than to go for the one for dad but tried to take the secind largest one my mom was immediately shrieking at me no no put that back its for your sister yours is the small one my parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study they are hung vertically on one wall the order is from top to bottom a picture of my dad a picture of my mom a picture of my sister a picture of my son then a picture of me iam at the very bottom like always iendured physical emotional and mental abuse ive seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year it helped but it hasnt enabled me forget i just have to deal with what happened and move forward im not social i dont really trust anyone or have any close friends but im okay with that tldr emotionally abused made me tough i survived it with a bit of therapy edit added tldr;no
yes a know how the fuck you survived that but so fucking strong have an anxiety endured award;weak
what do you love is there something you are passionate about something other than another person as people are inconstant and often unreliable that you are passionate about self destruction takes a lot of energy if you can refocus it on creation of almost anything other than say slashes on your wrists it might help you this is how i have found peace when i feel the monster stirring i write it poetry and kiss it goodnight i hope the best for you;weak
me too i dont care about studying or getting a job all i want to do is just ride my bike all day and play basketball i hate being home and criticized or judged for being slim and other stupid bullshit;no
maybe she just didnt know how to react to it or just in shock i think you should see a therapist because it seems that youre a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts theres more to life than peoples validation about you trust me it really gets better overtime bad thoughts will come and it will pass you need to find support of others to overcome it;weak
im really sorry for this im going through something similar and i have pretty much given up all hope that i am the same as my peers i am definitely not i feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself everyday is a day where i am buffeted by my own worthlessness i try my best i do i try my very best to get through every day is a drag but at least its a drag and not a standstill after a while i forget people exist really its just me and my depression i dont need any more love from my peers after some time;strong
i feel the same way at least i did for a while i talked to my doctor a couple years ago and basically i learned that depression is a mental illness and you can literally have no reason to be depressed like myself and still feel like absolute shit and want to cry all the time im pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it i myself am still trying to fight it but its only been maybe like 8 years so im sure it will get better eventually just stay strong my dude if you ever need anyone talk to you can pm me i stay up all hours of the night on the east coast;weak
sorry you are feeling that way but how do you know it was a lie in my experience most people dont compliment unless they meant it excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course who complimented you and in what context;strong
from what read only if an immidiate threat to yourself they will trace your call and call the cops quote me on that though as not 100 certain;no
i have to kickstart my ass into getting out of the house go to a museum arboretum take a walk somewhere once i get going its okay for a few hours but that only works when i dont wake up and start drinking sometimes when i come back home its the same old despair all over again;no
test mean literllery nothing in like 3 years you proballey wont even remember that test;weak
your foundation needs to fall down before you can start rebuilding have you started the plans the blueprint list everything on a paper or make a note in your head what you need to do to make things better im still rebuilding right now but i dont have this dark ugly building that overshadowed me now i can start thinking what the fuck i need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way i want it itll take time but its all worth it allow yourself to rebuild;weak
me too thats why i treat everyone like shit im hoping that one day nobody cares about me even my parents that day is the day ill become free from my despair;no
ya a few weeks ago my manager at work made a rude comment to me she does this all the time and it wasnt even that big of a deal but i was depressed for like 3 days i went home that night and legitimately wanted to die sometimes its just the straw that broke the camels back yknow;weak
everyone wants to forget something but most of the time we cant memories make us human good memories bad memories they really shouldnt make a difference now thats the past try and focus on the present and the future even if you create bad memories try and overcome them with positive lovely and beautiful ones ive been through this and still am going through it but i find it calming to talk to someone i love and care about maybe that could help you too;no
quite a few things ive noticed for myself ill over simplify my thought process to get the point across ill list them quickly i thought that if i could go through physical pain then i can go through mental pain a physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what i really wanted to tend to and cover up there was a couple times where i self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while i was trying to fall asleep afterwards i would spend some time in the bathroom alone taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished i forgot what i was thinking about self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game if life was beating me up maybe if i did a better job at that than life then maybe the punches life throws at me seem so bad since moved on from this these mindsets were unhealthy for me but recognizing them was essential to my own recovery;no
meds effect everyone differently call your doctor it might be bc of the meds or maybe youd feel this way now anyway ssris for me really help with anxiety but not at all for depression everyone is different;no
im around if you need someone to chat with im sorry youre feeling sad sometimes its such a painful and unbearable feeling;strong
im so sorry you feel that pain i know that pain all too well thats amazing that you went so long without it i can hardly manage three months and ive been doing it for years its hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to you are fine people slip up here and there;strong
ive noticed it helps me a lot to go outside during the day so that i can feel the sun if theres any and so i can smell fresh air;no
yep i do the same thing myself;no
youre a good man median i hope you know this i hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations but id rather you live personally;weak
hugs if you want them;strong
im sorry that youre also in this position im honestly just waiting for my parents to die so i can kill myself;strong
average is great at least you dont suck;weak
all day every day its definitely not just you lt3;weak
trust your intuition 99 of my friends treated me like garbage and when i got away from them and built my selfconfidence up i did things i never thought i would manage;no
im sorry that haopened ive never had a breakup because i always get rejected ive had similar things so i can at least get an idea of how that must feel but i believe you can find another girl you live;strong
really depends on the particular medication everyone responds differently as well i have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants but i am not a good example i know people who really improved while being on them it is a bit of a gamble and it can take time to find the suitable med for you i would say it is worth a try though;no
im not entirely certain what reaction youre getting but i hope youll give those around you a little slack if they cant be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first im sort of the designated problem solver in my circle so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy its never never a burden instead its an honor they trust me with their secrets their problems and value my opinion enough to ask for it reverse the situation arent you glad when someone comes to you the thing is not everyone is built for that especially i have found it can sort of weird people out when the rock the stable one the one person in this messed up world who has their stuff together needs help i mean heres the person they go to and they rely on when they need support and that person needs support suddenly youre not superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting perhaps try introducing a problem at a time slowly and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues good luck;weak
saw mine coming a mile away suffering from anxiety and depression and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult job was going to shit and stressing me out money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night one day it became too much started crying and having a panic attack didnt stop until i drank myself to sleep the next day i was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed that was three years ago;no
good luck friend i wish you the best there have been multiple times where i wondered if this was a good idea for me but i have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless i were married or something lol anyway know you are brave and i am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself you deserve to get better and i believe in you;weak
8 years of very severe suicidal depression i feel you mate im incredibly sorry;strong
yea especially since i regularly have lucid dreams its amazing except when you wake up with a bitter taste in your mouth;no
quote ive always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end if its not okay its not the end i understand that is a very hard thing to believe i went out of it over two and a half years and i hadnt ever known about these kinds of things until i was 19 just trying to say it can be done man love you;strong
hug i cant remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either i need a hug or a cuddle so bad the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me i feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time i dont know how long i can go on best of luck;strong
cocaine keeps accidentally falling into my nose that pesky cocaine;no
yess i feel you and i guess being depressed is bad for you as well so youre just trading one bad thing for another except this one makes you happy so yeah basically why i do it;weak
this will probably not help you but i had a very long depression i was unable to do the most simple tasks sleeping in my own trash i lacked the energy to clean my god damn place how much more useless could i become sounds funny but its true hurting my self crying to sleep no friends and honestly looking back i was a complete waste of space better off to have my brains blown the fuck out but that doesnt mean we dont have the potential to completely change things around this was me 2 years ago for a solid decade i was barely hanging on and now ive changed everything around and i do not suffer from daily suicidal thoughts self harm and long depressing episodes;no
i know you mean well but this really help a large majority of people with depression plenty of people afford professional help or it work for them some people myself included make any friends at all the negativity among other things that comes with this illness is like a poisonous cloud that brings other people down with you and ultimately pushes them away;weak
im sorry my friend i lost my mum too two years ago i feel your pain but itll get better for you i promise;strong
just another day to throw away typically with an extra helping of faked emotions and facial expressions to keep my friends and family under the impression that im okay on that day when its the day i wish didnt happen its fucking exhausting;no
not hollywood per se but ned vizzini suicide hit me hard now live for real craig live live live i feel many similarities between him and me same age etc a successful author but this disease is just too much sometimes;no
i guess kind of our fault but at the same time i think we desperately wish we could be better sometimes we really physically and emotionally can not be better stay strong not alone;weak
can you openup a bit to explain whats the matter go on if its alright with you;no
why not try and get to know some of us may help short term;no
im sorry to hear how youre feeling right now and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent and everything will hopefully make sense all i can really say right now is to strive on do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved i wish you a wonderful future op and hope that one day everything will be better;strong
once you are at the bottom you can only go up hope things get better for you ;weak
anything can happen in 2017 happy new year to you and i hope this one wont be a waste;weak
im sorry i hope you get a good day soon;strong
sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong
depression is hell i feel ya;weak
i think i can only live if i keep myself happy if i relax the nightmares come  ;no
you do not need a reason to be depressed and there is no reason to feel guilty for being depressed for no reason;no
great work wanted to tell you i too am proud of you i saw someone as well after a last year i am very proud of you and ever think there is anything wrong with seeing someone;strong
uhhh who sorry i cant help you very much;strong
being alone is terrible im sorry youre alone if i hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there then i suggest doing just about anything different anything really break your horrible lonely routine the only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change what can you do differently tomorrow;strong
im sorry my friend i lost my mum too two years ago i feel your pain but itll get better for you i promise;strong
very sorry to hear it she came back the first time;strong
im so sorry to hear about your situationthats a really difficult thing to have to endure especially with your familys lack of understanding i dont think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your paineven if there is not a reliable treatment now pain relief is a major area of medical science research is medical marijuana legal where you live or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is you might find support and recommendations at rsciatica hang in there i would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if thats an option otherwise it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity paid or unpaid that is meaningful to you if movement is an issue look up online opportunities which will help you get your mind off of your pain;strong
so sorry hurting so much here;strong
please be safe and seek help i have been really depressed and lonely before where i tried what you tried i took over 20 pills trying to od to end up at the doctors with them believing it was a virus i also tried cutting but i was too scared of the pain i lived through the loneliness and pain only to be depressed again but i came to a realization i deserve better and i am worth it its definitely hard and a battle everyday but with professional help i am getting better day by day you deserve better and you are worth it please stay strong and i do hope you talk to someone to get the help you need;weak

just fucking do it what could go wrong make your life about being grateful for everything and you will not be disappointed stay busy dont let yourself get lost in anything but her make loving her your first and for most job and you will never be disappointed or sad;weak
it is a sector in boom right now there are tons of jobs and its only growing you will have no problem finding a job whatsoever however i understand your worry is money even after you get a job keep looking and applying the more experience you have the better you can probably find jobs that pay higher and higher idk how far youre in right now through your course but if its not too late try taking some security courses as well while it is in a boom having security courses on your resume would almost guarantee that you will always have a job literally every company needs help with security and theyre will to pay lots of money to find it everything will be fine;weak
you could always leave them and find your own indipendence sorrounding yourself with the people you love which are not part of your family idk your situation actually but i felt the same way too many times so lonely and neglected by the ones that should care the most it happens but this perception is not necessary the truth killing yourself wont solve or change anything;weak
there are people who want to know more if you dont fake it but some people are not worth knowing your secrets so just dont mind them smile and move on however it can become stressful if you have nobody to talk to in a realistic way as possible without anything fake at all on you with people where you can toss that mask away for a moment and just be that negative little cunt for a moment lol we all need it sometimes;weak
its not immature to have suicidal thoughts but it is however unfair that you were judged for it some people just dont understand how something feels until they experience it themselves i was always told that my suicidal tendencies were not only annoying but they were also bullshit it took me a while to accept that its not wrong to reach out and want someone to care and help you;weak
sometimes it does feel like people suck but with billions of them around theres bound to be a lot of good ones;no
i like to do healthy or productive hobbies when i feel like that sometimes its all i look forward to in my day and it helps pull me through one day at a time i think talking to others will help a lot too if you wanna chat you can pm me;weak
often times people take laughter as a cue that what doing is okay i do the same thing whenever someone picks on me even though it hurts inside for all of us let other opinions influence how you see yourself as hard as that can be lt3;weak
thanks friend do the same for you;weak
i feel very much like you id like to give you advice but im just as broken so ill just let you know that i feel with you here maybe that will help;weak

hi there im not often online and when online its erratic and random but i can give it a go if you want hugs and hope things become better for you soon ;strong
sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out it lets you feel powerful in control of things in therapy they teach you to sitdown often and sort through your emotions what emotion are you experiencing right now how do you identify it what caused you to feel like this what steps can you make to prevent this feeling try to walk yourself through some of these exercises they might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future;strong
i feel you there and i am so sorry those people suck;strong

sorry to hear i hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again;strong
ah im sorry  panic attack are awful but you certainly shouldnt feel embarrassed;strong
sometimes i feel like this is okay though the not being okay i think theres this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal also i get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters its actually the most liberating because then i am truly free of my worldly concerns i dont know silver lining and framing and all that jazz best of luck friend;weak
you cant fix everything because thats impossible no one would expect you to fix everything youre only human ya know;weak
hey its okay man life sucks dick just keep pushing through;weak
wait does this mean youre seeing someone already i can see the concern but if youre already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isnt really better you can always look for a second opinion im getting help but before i was and while i was trying to find the right combo of things id have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently like 45 days out of a week it sucked hard right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week sometimes i make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself even if its not actually enjoyable this combo sucks and i hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern;weak
really sorry going through this basically going through the same thing right now let me know if you ever wanna chat things will get better eventually i hope;strong
sorry its hard i hated it;weak
this is so me i have social anxiety ocd and anxiety and depression too 20 and feel the exact same way;no
i always wanted to die in my dreams because id like to believe id get to stay in them probably wouldnt happen that way;no
its okay not to be okay a lot of us in this sub are in the same boat as you you are not alone lt3;weak
for what worth it probably mean much coming from a complete stranger but glad it failed or the world would have just lost 1 more good person and we are low on them as is you can pm me anytime if you wanna talk;strong
i feel like a pro would be validation when a psychiatrist told me that yes i do have anxiety it really helped me to feel like i wasnt just over reacting you know another pro would be future doctors that you see understanding your diagnoses i cant really think of an con to be honest its also possible that whoever is prescribing your medication has diagnosed you already i would ask;no
yea sorry i know how you feel feeling very alone today;strong
you writing this amp still being here i think thats a good signi think it means that deep down theres still hope that things will get better amp youll start feeling happier amp less lonely hold on to that feeling amp if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me;weak
im sorry for however long you still have to deal with them but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to and that is 100 okay you are your own very awesome person and they dont get a say in who you are;strong
im sorry man i wish i could take the pain away;strong
what life path are you;no
at least its something would you rather have them pity you or not give a shit i feel alone with everyone im around i think itd be worse knowing im truly alone embrace it because they love you regardless how you are as a person hows that for not wanting to be pitied  ;no
what im trying to say is that routine is significantly important and the first thing many clinical psychologists ask is if you have a job basically makes you set up a routine and routines make you less likely to develop depression if they are balanced and will make your enjoyment of life increase as well;no
i know exactly how you feel just one day of many though take it one hour one minute at a time think about some self care you can do for yourself once you get home having one of those days too but try not to let the depression get too deep fight it plan for a nice bath at home or makepick up your favorite meal on your way home you are a wonderful human being and you deserve happiness just get through today tomorrow will be another opportunity for something better feel free to pm me if you want someone to vent to to pass the time;weak
a lot of people turn to drinking alcohol to escape from feeling shit to feel better or feel like nothing matters the first 2 maybe 3 drinks kind of gives us a who cares attitude but when we keep drinking it does make us feel more vulnerable and fragile making us emotionally worse ive done this many times what do you like doing what do you like spendin your time on movies tv games being creative could be anything what is yours;no
im sorry to hear how youre feeling right now and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent and everything will hopefully make sense all i can really say right now is to strive on do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved i wish you a wonderful future op and hope that one day everything will be better;strong
im so sorry are u ok;strong

you are not alone just remember that;weak
as you get older you might be glad to find them not remembered i think its important to not rely on external validation easy to say right but also to provide that support to others lets say you try to make to recognise the birthday or other significant event for at least two other people you know this year i dont know if that will help;weak
yeah i often wonder if i am just negativeungratefullazyetc or if there really is a legit label for it constant battle in my head;no

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
