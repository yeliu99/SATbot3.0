everyones brain chemistry is different so its going to have differing effects at differing times for everyone the doctor cant really say for sure because science doesnt even really know how or why the drug truly works its just a general rule that they have to tell you is to give it at least 6 weeks or so not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks thats when it usually kicks in for me as well and yes they are designed to build up in your system over time so it should keep on getting better for 6 months or so with diminishing increases over time for it to be at full strength but again everyone is affected a little differently source have been on many anti depressants for almost a decade;no

you realize what s wrong theres many things wrong and even though youre depressed you are comfortable in some way because realizing you must change your ways can put some one in a discomfort zone truth is you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness an example some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body but he knows that the outcome is what matters he has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght theres no other way thats just how life is a surgery to lose wieght would be a pass theres no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way;no

its the little things that get me i suppose whether its a happy evening spent with family or an exciting roadtrip everything just has something off about it i also have anxiety so this may play a role as well but nearly every situation i can think of is tarnished by this overwhelming feeling of something being wrong you feel out of place all the time and disconnected like youre missing out on something everyone else is getting and for me i have no idea what is wrong since its impossible to pinpoint what isnt there thus since the emotional side of everything is numbed this feels like a storybook somewhere im a useless side character that the hero will never meet or care about i want to feel happy i just dont this blankness is whats really killing me because now i cant build relationships or imagine a future im destined to live alone and with no purpose if you want a better grasp of the perspective imagine seeing everyone as perfectly fine whereas you for whatever reason are the most ugly and screwedup person imaginable i know or think i know that its rubbish but i cant help but believe the voices you know;no

sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out it lets you feel powerful in control of things in therapy they teach you to sitdown often and sort through your emotions what emotion are you experiencing right now how do you identify it what caused you to feel like this what steps can you make to prevent this feeling try to walk yourself through some of these exercises they might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future;strong

happy birthday and fuck everyone else whos a dick;no
that is a very true definition of sadness just out of curiosity why wouldnt you want to take a risk of trying different medications that might help you you dont know how they affect you until you try them you state that things are unbearable now so it seems worthwhile to try something that might help you to be happier  even if it causes a side effect of growing a 2nd big toe on your right foot   the internet is hard to scientifically research complicated subjects most of the better data amp studies are not accessible or behind paywalls  i hope that you are feeling a little better we get new opportunities every day but it is hard to get over mistakes in the past sometimes unfortunately we cant change the past until i finish the time machine that im working on in my basement  feel free to contribute to my kickstarter fundraiser ;weak
sometimes i feel like this is okay though the not being okay i think theres this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal also i get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters its actually the most liberating because then i am truly free of my worldly concerns i dont know silver lining and framing and all that jazz best of luck friend;weak
i feel the same way and i guess kind of teach myself to just breakdown and cry when i get too overwhelmed with those kinds of feelings;no

there are actually some studies that support this depressed people are more likely to correctly assess probabilities and riskreward in many situations however we also have documentable thought process issues the primary being black and white thinking allornothing so i dont think we get to claim to be the sane ones ;no
theres absolutely no point but thats beauty of it you get to choose everything do whatever the fuck you want do i feel like rolling out of bed today maybe i can sleep in all day or i can slowly inch out you have the strength to do anything but it takes time depending on how much of a deviation it is from your normalcy its obviously not going to come at all once so take baby steps and that applies to everything because once you get goingobjects in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force so make monday your bitch fuck make it a damn saturday the point is you dont have to follow along by the universes plan if you dont want to then dont do it but all it takes is a single want to leave your bed and thatll come eventually so why delay it youre not going to hide in your covers forever are you or is today the day you whip the universe into submission by just thinking about it;weak

why the heck do we hate ourselves man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else sorry to get weird there it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves anyway i have one scar on my arm from one time that i tried that and there forever it still makes me sad when i see it so sorry for what pain you are in there will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself amp the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face;strong

oh if a boss did that to me id debate the heck out of him and put a mirror against him to make him understand his flaws unless feelings of job loss risks arise no boss is going to get away with putting his workers down as ideally were meant to cooperate together and not be slaves of one another;weak
you arent i dont get defensive but yes talking about it to people make me feel like im burdoning them and then i feel even more like shit because im pushing my problems on someone else whats going on with you;no

for me its because i think im a broken bottle of poison all i do is hurt those around me so i keep away both spirit and body those who care enough to try and help fix me end up getting hurt and in the end im still just a vial of poison all im capable of doing is hurting others im guessing this type of mindset sorta leaked into everything i do so i tell myself not only do they do not want to be with me they are better off for it;no
i cant remember the last time i was happy seriously but i think i understand you you are so used to being depressed like its your normal state of being and then you can feel this tiny bit of happiness and it feels strange like you dont deserve it i think you do deserve it;weak
i cant and i feel like a failure because of it it has been extrodinarily hard for me to hold a job and i became homeless long term because of it i still cant function like a normal productive citizen despite going back to work numerous times its even harder when the peoppe around you judge im 31 now and most of my peers have their own houses by now its so agonizing for me even though i am happy for them ill keep trying to get myself back though im sorry youre going through this op;strong

im so sorry you feel that pain i know that pain all too well thats amazing that you went so long without it i can hardly manage three months and ive been doing it for years its hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to you are fine people slip up here and there;strong
thats a pretty profound question but i think happiness is something that a lot of people dont understand in a period or prolonged period of despair i dont believe there can be happiness at all and its only after that period has been solved over attacked enough by effort and time that you can start experiencing happiness i dont think happiness and gratitude should be forced or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy im still going through that period and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way but they are fleeting and leave very quickly the whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories think about it which memories are the quickest strongest and most easily able to be remembered for you the most emotional ones if your most emotional memories are negative you will be in despair on the converse if ones most emotional memories are positive you will be in a state of happiness there is a way to end your despair you just have to face it head on and let go of everything and keep trying to let go and accept very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole;weak
good for you i hope that your day gets even better ;weak
same i feel like i have failed to reach every goal i have set for myself although i kinda just accepted it at this point and stopped caring that i always fail and it strangely helps me get not so depressed about it anymore;no

you know what i feel exactly the same and i was trying to be positive for once i literally am having daily breakdowns because of school right now and honestly i wont make it through this year the thing is summer can maybe make you think straight and give you energies to start again i was trying to say that maybe they dont change and stay depressed all summer but they could try at least summer is free time always letting your mind rest is good even if you dont do a thing;no
great way of putting it life is just so exhausting i cant leave the house without caffeine i have no interests i just feel like an empty battery hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance;weak
this may be a tough concept to accept but you should be happy that others have that something you lack be honest with yourself do you see all of those relationships your friends have lasting for decades finding love is complex i wouldnt say youre wasting your time doing nothing ive seen this too many times where people spend days after days trying to find the one that just now how it works although it is true that if you dont look you wont find in most cases you shouldnt fear not finding love cause thats just not how it works i wouldnt say love finds you either thats also not how it works i wouldnt ponder too much about not finding the one or love time will tell it will come during that time try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself you want to be with someone because you want to be with them not because you fear being lonely give it time talk to your friends enjoy yourself;weak

sounds like apathy to me im guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you while apathy is one symptom of depression it doesnt necessarily mean that you have depression by no means am i downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isnt any on true definition of depression i felt like you for a while just a few small pleasures but nothing really else for me it went away after a few months if you want to talk about it more or anything feel free to ask anything my only advice is dont give up now because if it goes away youll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about;weak
im sorry that haopened ive never had a breakup because i always get rejected ive had similar things so i can at least get an idea of how that must feel but i believe you can find another girl you live;strong
trust me i am done with it too and you dont suffer alone bro so find comfort in that;weak
im so sorry you feel that way would you like to elaborate im here if you need to chat;strong
yes several years ago i was on abilify and cymbalta i think the whole call your doctor if you experience worsening thoughts of depression and suicide thing became a reality;no
school is probably about the most stressful thing in my life right now i cant put myself to actually work hard at school because i just cant get myself to care enough my family expects so much out of me and i constantly let them down;no
it happens to me quite often sometimes im just having just another regular day in which im busy doing work and stuff suddenly i realize that im feeling fine or even happy and thats when all the bad thoughts and reasons to be worried or sad storm in i really dont know how to deal with them i wish i could find a way i know ive lived through some stuff that still weighs on me and i know that time helps to ease the pain but its really difficult to keep it together sometimes and being unable to enjoy the little things of each day makes it frustrating in some way i hope that youll find a way around it;weak
good luck dont you have any friends in school by the way;weak
sorry you are feeling that way but how do you know it was a lie in my experience most people dont compliment unless they meant it excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course who complimented you and in what context;strong
this is also me seemingly every goddamn fucking day too we may never know how we ended up this way but hopefully we can figure out how to come out the other end of it i wish nothing but strength to you to keep on carrying on this sub right here shows youre not alone in this struggle;weak
i felt this exact way when i first went as well i felt like it was a grilling of my life and i even tried to lie and say that im mostly 100 happy with my life and that i just wish i had more friends and cleaned the house more yeah right im a mess a lot of the time and have so many problems i dont know where to begin eventually once i started to know my therapist and dive into the smaller issues did she really start to open up and i opened up myself as well keep going the first day is the hardest i think;no
id rather be down forever than be in a roller coaster of emotion i know that once i am happy i will be sad again the fall is just too painful id rather embrace this sadness forever;no
that has to be tough its different strokes for different folks of course but i might have a suggestion i find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts my understanding is that there are two default brain modes one is random thought day dreaming for example and the other is processing so you need to switch from day dreaming to processing and that is hard for everyone start with meditation close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing if your thoughts drift from breathing then shut it down n snap back to breathing dont get emotional just stay calm and focus on breathing when finished move everything that is a distraction away from you no phone no internet if possible just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing this focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become dont expect to focus for hours on end but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus also make studying fun or less boring take notes highlight pages repeat the things you read most importantly try telling a story with what you are learning its a strong method for memorization people with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes good luck;no
you say youll never be able to move out    sure you will would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away obviously to move out you will need a good paying job and money for an apt by your self or with roommates tell your family that you are moving out on x date if you are over 18 they cant really do anything about it tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where suicide i dont think is ever the answer;no
god damn i honestly feel the exact same as you in every aspect sometimes i also just sit back and think about how none of this feels real then the suicidal thoughts come on because i feel like there has to be more then more sad more depersonalized and its just a vicious cycle nothing matters but we should at least live to the fullest because in relative terms it matters no idea how to do that though;weak
if you quit now you rob yourself of any chance for life to ever get better;no

you are loved and you can get through this;weak
people never notice ive gotten really good at hiding it and compensating by being an asshole truth is the vast majority of people either dont care or dont even pick up on it in the first place well off to bed gotta put on the mask and go to work in the morning;no
sorry to hear that feel free to pm if you want to;strong
i think its more likesuicide is selfish but so is asking someone to not commit suicide so the argument is just kind of invalid because its merely a question of who gets to be selfish;no
trying to do something but its never what you want it to be like distractions work but not for ever i dont know how long my next one will last binge watching netflix is a great one for me you dont have to think about anything and just get completely emerged in it but even that wont last for long now;no
see if you can build on it maybe go out and do something youve never tried i know im not the one to talk because i dont go anywhere haha but since you feel good it might be worth trying something new and building on it;no
ill be honest i feel kinda sorry for you you have completely nobody perhaps you had some people but due to some things those relationships didnt work out;strong
wait does this mean youre seeing someone already i can see the concern but if youre already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isnt really better you can always look for a second opinion im getting help but before i was and while i was trying to find the right combo of things id have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently like 45 days out of a week it sucked hard right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week sometimes i make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself even if its not actually enjoyable this combo sucks and i hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern;weak

it is unfair modern psychologypsychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness it often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others dont suffer from grief should we commit suicide as we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness policies and social norms will change some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness but whats strange about all of this is even though im certain i have the right to kill myself because im miserable everyday i am pulling for you to live even though youre a stranger on the internet i have hope for you and i dont even know you i want you to wait it out to battle it out not because you owe me or anyone else but because i think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now what have you tried so far to get some relief has anything worked what can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment;weak
ah im sorry  panic attack are awful but you certainly shouldnt feel embarrassed;strong
i wish this wasnt quite as true but the truth just hurts;no
theres no better person to tell someone something than a nurturing mother they typically love you unconditionally friends and significant others get a scent of the depression on you and they distance themselves as it becomes a deeper problem as opposed to helping if your mother loves you she will understand and its not like you are admitting you have gay sex or addictions to banging drugs up your arm or killed someone this is not to be insensitive remotely benign to say to your family they might be able to recommend something that helps;weak
sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong
ive read that the minimum lethal dose of hydroxyzine is 1650 mg but that is impossible to calculate correctly because of body weight differences in absorption etc with luvox full recovery with minimal effects has been noted at overdoses of up to 9 grams you might be successful especially if you are small and dont weigh much but there is a not insignificant chance you might end up alive and brain damaged instead i know im a stranger but i am sorry about whatever has brought you to this point do consider trying to get help  even if you have before think about it one last time;strong
there is also another factor that you sometimes dont notice how you are perceived by others by body language im a really shy introverted person but i had multiple people telling me that i came over as real angry threatening dude with a frown on my face and i never noticed this in my entire life so you need to be confident in yourself showing through body language that you are a good guy to hang out with i simply cant say how to do it but thats one way to explain this;no
im in the same boat if i do get drunk its not the fun kind its more like all those depressing thoughts start boiling over i dont drink liquor anymore for that reason now i stick to a few beers every night and thats usually enough to help me relax;no
hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong
heya buddy i can relate after 18 years of struggling i finally found out i have dyslexia fine motor control issues and short term memory loss it was like i had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so i cant do academics i am different but id rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things i cant i can do something better then they can know how to go through hard times and keep pushing when life gets hard for them they will break and i wont be there to help them dont worry about other people they will become dust while you will become a diamond my question to you is how are you going to move forward;weak

im so sorry to hear about your situationthats a really difficult thing to have to endure especially with your familys lack of understanding i dont think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your paineven if there is not a reliable treatment now pain relief is a major area of medical science research is medical marijuana legal where you live or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is you might find support and recommendations at rsciatica hang in there i would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if thats an option otherwise it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity paid or unpaid that is meaningful to you if movement is an issue look up online opportunities which will help you get your mind off of your pain;strong
sorry to hear that man what are you studying do you feel like the material you are studying is hard or is the volume of the work too much;strong
maybe it would exhaust them more over time but the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt they may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves they will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life talk with your family work through it together accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you it will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier;weak
been there but can i give a really cool trick that might truly help when looking for a job try to find a new storerestaurantplace opening up no matter what it is it was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc anyway what worked for me in the end either way keep trying taking it one step at a time fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews if you get too anxious and go then go but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go and if you start working and like it ok you can look elsewhere so just keep pushing along;weak
think of someone that you look up to actor musician famous person and act like them;no
life is not what happens to you  its how you react to it if you feel sorry for yourself and most depressed people do its because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it its showing sympathy for a person and youre the person because you arent getting it from anyone else it all comes down to what comes after that you can give up and never try again or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future  imagine feeling this way and doing nothing about it for a year 5 years 10 years what has your life become  now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed brush your teeth went to the store or coffee shop talked to someone helped someone every day now imagine doing that for a year 5 years 10 years now what is your life like;no

sorry feeling so stressed right now op do you want to talk more about your making you so stressed;strong
maybe theyre just jealous that hes spending more time with you than them regardless its not nice for them to make to be making lies about you does your boyfriend know that they are;no
i get it at some point a few years ago i stopped being able to feel joy even when im feeling stable i still dont feel happy when ive described this to my therapist and psychiatrist they challenge me on it  you talk about good things dont you feel happy when those happen  but i know the difference it is very much like an old lost friend i actually might use that metaphor in therapy this week;weak
im so sorry i understand your loss my grandma just passed away on 0526 its hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories i know it seems cliche but it really does get better with time;strong

maybe she just didnt know how to react to it or just in shock i think you should see a therapist because it seems that youre a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts theres more to life than peoples validation about you trust me it really gets better overtime bad thoughts will come and it will pass you need to find support of others to overcome it;weak
hi there i care i wanna listen to your story and we can become pen pals pm me anytime you want;weak

more i live more its harder to think so;no
i can tell you this much if you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference then id say that its worth enduring the negative side effects as a side note i feel like ive heard ofknown people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them but its probably different from person to person i have no idea what the future holds for you and theres probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication so good luck;weak
sometimes i feel like this is okay though the not being okay i think theres this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal also i get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters its actually the most liberating because then i am truly free of my worldly concerns i dont know silver lining and framing and all that jazz best of luck friend;weak
sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out it lets you feel powerful in control of things in therapy they teach you to sitdown often and sort through your emotions what emotion are you experiencing right now how do you identify it what caused you to feel like this what steps can you make to prevent this feeling try to walk yourself through some of these exercises they might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future;strong
im sorry for your pain wanna talk;strong

you do whatever you need to do;no
i feel like its a paradox people would call you or i selfish but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof many people cant relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth but for those who can being called selfish for suicidal thoughts makes it all the more confusing of a situation it also shows you who really cares cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route for themselves which is fucked while some may call it manipulation whatever the name its hardly sympathetic and isnt even close to empathetic which empathy is what this world is lacking a partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition but we live in a male dominated monotheistic world people suck the only thing we can do is help them so thats why i think suicide is hard youre not helping anyone;no
glad you found something to help even if just a little;weak
do something to take care of yourself please just something one thing;no
i kind of agree with you but doing all that requires an actual effort and energy sometimes im just happy to get through the day its a vicious cycle of being unhappy with yourself and having zero motivation to change something;weak

i can only recommend fiction apologies not much of a selfhelpnonfiction kind of guy but the perks of being a wallflower the film never read the book myself deals with depression among other things and is very powerful much of sylvia plaths poetry centres around mental health and depression if thats of interest and while its not something ive read the bell jar which is prose is also supposed to be very good according to a former acquaintance of mine and i recently finished watching an anime called orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about saving people quite a lot which can be a little bit galling lol musicwise brand new have done a number of songs which either deal with depression or emotions that can be closely linked to depression or are pretty evocative in that sense tonallyspeaking cant think of anything else right off the top of my head but hopefully thats a fair amount of stuff in the shortterm at least;no
main focus should be on yourself and your own personal interests be solid on a selfdevelopment mindset be more selfaware of yourself and your goals;no

im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong
im sorry that haopened ive never had a breakup because i always get rejected ive had similar things so i can at least get an idea of how that must feel but i believe you can find another girl you live;strong
heya buddy i can relate after 18 years of struggling i finally found out i have dyslexia fine motor control issues and short term memory loss it was like i had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so i cant do academics i am different but id rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things i cant i can do something better then they can know how to go through hard times and keep pushing when life gets hard for them they will break and i wont be there to help them dont worry about other people they will become dust while you will become a diamond my question to you is how are you going to move forward;weak

ive been taking prozac for eight years it lessens my irritability and makes me slightly more functional without altering my personality;no
i feel you have you thought about speaking to a therapist or call a depression hotline im not sure where you are living but those calls are usually free and the people on the other end are pretty great at listening and coming up with helpful strategies hang in there;weak
you did the right thing i respect that you got help to save yourself takes a lot of balls you cant choose family ive got only my mom since 11 i dont have an uncle or aunt who hang out with me you can choose your friends and to me friends are more important they kinda replaced my family and its horribly wrong when people ask you those questions im so mad right now fuck man that guy has 0 empathy i know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself you dont need them to save you they should be supporting you if not then not dont give a shit about them its a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy i may sound cringe but empathy is something i learned with 3 or 4 i dont know what is going wrong with some people;weak
please maybe someday soon something will go right happen for me but maybe for you;weak
i feel the same way i know what i need to do but i just cant and that kills me even more;no
this was two months ago how are you now;no
thats why im repeating 11th grade it sucks;weak
hopefully they can help you;weak
so sorry hurting so much here;strong
oh shit man please fucking dont firstly death by acid is more painful than having your dna ripped apart by radiation secondly explain your life situation to me and we can talk im here for you;strong
idk why twice but seriously i wish you the best to get through this even though idk what this may be also i loved atla too even though i watched it years after it aired;weak
and im also too scared;no
i had this perception for a long time myself but i realized eventually its because i wasnt reaching out to them myself im here and i havent forgotten about you im here to help ;weak
at least we dont have the horrid fear of our own mortality like nondepressives i asked a question about aging and losing looks on another and most posted they didnt mind losing their looks but facing mortality was difficult it really made me think wow so there is an upside to depression i look forward to dying;no
sorry to hear that hopefully it goes by quick;strong
sorry you are feeling that way but how do you know it was a lie in my experience most people dont compliment unless they meant it excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course who complimented you and in what context;strong
this is so true but sometimes when in the funk of depression it just feels like those beautiful thingsmoments in life are so far fetched feels like the pain go away;no
we all are and thats ok;weak
i hear you brothersister i recently stepped down from management position so i can work by myself its a bit better;weak
great way of putting it life is just so exhausting i cant leave the house without caffeine i have no interests i just feel like an empty battery hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance;weak
its true in certain contexts when youre at the lowest point of depression yes its going to get better depression overall probably not going anywhere life no promises could get better or worse;no
im very proud of you too remember the great feeling of success you have right now it will help you next time you have the urge;strong
chill man high school isnt that bad all you have to do is just be chill and if you dont want to talk to anyone thats fine but eventually someone will want to talk to you thats just how it is ;strong
why do you feel like that it makes me sad to read something like that often the good people in this world have the most troubles but please dont give up;weak
you are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and i think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings im sorry i couldnt help more and hope you get better;strong
unless surrounded by loving people you the last thing you want is for your happiness to depend on others;no
yeah maybe they are trying to make you feel good if you have people saying youre cute though then thats a big deal even if theyre doing it for other reasons youre a lot more cute and attractive than me based on this being a complaint rather than being flattered;weak
when i felt this way i came to the conclusion that i didnt know who i was without these feelings i didnt know what i liked anymore would i be empty without this sadness that sort of thought process it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help its natural to be afraid of things changing but when you feel ready to these changes are for the better;weak
what makes you say these things;no
i always have herbal otc sleeping supplements prepared in case that happens relaxing teas works too but then you are sleepy and have to go to the toilet in many cases they work pretty well;no
thats hard especially if youre the type of person to post in this sub loving yourself is really difficult but loving others is easier and i do love you when you love others i find its easier to love yourself even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good i hope i helped;strong
you can talk to me about anything i wont judge and im here to help could really use someone to talk to myself;weak
what help do you want;no
i bite on my tongue for that reason no risk of hurting yourself seriously if you pay attention just hurts;no
hey i know who you are what doing or even thinking right now but i do hope that still here for now at least and reading this comment really sorry for how feeling right now and even though been through this for the last 2 years already i say that i understand how you feel even though i wish that i could but please please know that if you still need to talk you could message me yeah this truly is a really shitty world but in light of all this there are still people who are genuinely kind who would really want to help being a beacon of light for those who are still suffering and letting the light from others shine onto you this the purpose of living the purpose of still staying here;strong
thats so true on the outside i look fine always smiling at people and being silly but inside i empty just going through the motions i just dont see the point in alot of things anymore the only thing that helps with me in a way is caring about someone else the only thing i can feel is loving someone else gives me a reason to keep going in a way i guess;no
good morning bro im happy that you woke up and read this comment i hope you have a great day today;strong
i do i love a man i hate i hate him for letting me fall madly in love with him i hate him for telling me he fell madly in love with me i hate him for lying to me constantly for leading me on for introducing me to his family amp friends  i hate him for plunging into me and my life  only to abandon me and the children he led in to believe be there for i hate him for making me collateral damage amp not recognizing the fact that ruined 3 lives i hate him for lifting me up and sucking all the beauty happiness and bright life from my soul i hate him for making a million promises and not keeping one of them i hate a man that took my undying unwavering unconditional priceless love  i hate a man that failed to return to me the faithfulness respect and admiration i so boundlessly and freely gave to him i hate this man that reached into my soul and crushed it with his bare hands into an oblivion i hate him for staring into my eyes and telling me he loves me only to leave me for a lie i hate him for constantly and consistently telling me we will be together after the next month i hate him for turning me into a complete and utterly worthless piece of carnagea wreck a mess a heartbroken little girl i hate him because i stop loving him i hate a man i love;no
vidya and riding my bike while contemplating my life;no
no because i dont know what i can do to make it better although the motivation and concentration doesnt help;no
that word makes me confused i dont understand it so many people say they feel incredibly lonely yet here i am with the same sickness not even comprehending what that weird word is supposed to mean;no
hugs try and take care of yourself i know it seems hopeless and like your trapped but dont let this fucker get the best of you;strong
i feel you i grew a full beard between visits to my folks not a word;weak

dont do it whatever there is ailing you you know its hard but you can overcome it youre a human being you sent people to space and conquered the animal kingdom you can conquer depression;weak
yeah  my parents make me anxious to the point where i wont get food and water because im afraid of running into them glad to be moving out;no
whats up buddy  want to talk ;weak
do your parents tell you that youre a failure my mom and dad both did that to me for a while im 16 i used to be depressed over my bad grades and i had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and i would amount to nothing then all of a sudden one day i noticed that bad grades in high school arent the end of the world it might have been because i moved out of my dads place and i didnt have to hear him call me a failure anymore either way i became happy again then i met her a nice girl who was my age she had a pretty face we had a ton of classes together and she thought i was really funny i was able to open up to her i think i know i fell in love with her she had a boyfriend though hes a shitty person hes high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls i really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and id be the happiest guy in the world that didnt happen i became desperate i began to have a drinking problem because of it one night while very drunk i texted her a bunch of things about my depression i dont think she cares about me anymore now i find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how i let myself get depressed again  basically what i wanna say to you is your lifes not over its just beginning whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome just focus on you and dont let other people get in your way and bring you down like i did dont let anyone else determine your happiness control your life you can do it;weak
thats hard especially if youre the type of person to post in this sub loving yourself is really difficult but loving others is easier and i do love you when you love others i find its easier to love yourself even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good i hope i helped;strong
appreciate that you have someone to love i guess i dont know the situation sorry you feel that way guys like me will never have anyone to love though so yay at least you arent me;weak
please do whatever stuff that makes your feel your own worth in your case thats a good stuff if youre in the path towards the positives keep on walking good luck;weak
what is going on how long have you been thinking about this maybe we should talk about it first and think through some stuff;weak
they tell you to get help because they dont know what else to do if they tell you to go on with your suicide and you do they dont want that guilt in their life but if they tell you to get help and it actually works they can feel good about having helped someone helping a depressed person is kind of tricky if you dont really know what depression is like i usually just let them know that theyre not alone and i know what its like;no
i always think that to myself when im feeling suicidal but theres always something that keeps me going and i just havent figured it out yet maybe because in the end of all of this there is a light at the end of the tunnel last night i had an incredibly suicidal episode ive hurt myself in the past as well and while i dont know how you feel personally i can relate when i feel the way i do its really hard to try and see the world around me your mom just doesnt understand what youre going through and you need someone that can support you hell even ill do it and i dont even know you sorry if i am ranting but i do just think that you need to find the right people that can help lift you up my mother hasnt supported me in any of my depression and anxiety issues at all and its the loneliest feeling in the world thats why i turned to so if you need support you can talk to me i dont judge ever;weak
mate get yourself down to hospital and have an ecg make enquiries about this i had the same thing and wrote it off as anxiety and it got worse in my case it wasnt just anxiety take the condition of your heart seriously if youre worried get it checked;no
in there my friend im here for you;weak
sometimes specifically the spectator thing its a depersonalizationderealization thing i think;no
side effects were bad but the withdrawal was worse than coming down from opiates over a month later having rebound headaches and dizziness i would suggest never taking it;no
i always think that other ppl have great lives when i see them at work or out wherever and i have this shitty life and id rather be dead but i always pretend to be happy it makes it easier to get through the day i wonder how many other ppl have looked at me and thought my life must be pretty awesome;no
sounds like a rough ride would you like to quit drinking;weak
sorry to hear youre feeling this way can you see a doctor or a psychiatrist they can help you get anti depressant medication they will also probably tell you to make an appointment with a therapist and to see a therapist regularly hope this helps;strong
roll with the bald look i say i dont really think twice when i see a bald person regardless of age ;weak
ive been on leave for 10 weeks from work;no
a sign of emotional strength and mental strength keep it up on your team ;weak
i hear you so well and im so sorry you feel that way i left my difficulttogetinto art school because of this and my classmates treated it like high school and were jerks but thats irrelevant its not easy;strong
is it bc they have relationships and you dont try talking to someone from rbraincels;no
i bought my self kfc no one is doing anything or i should say i was invited to nothing im sorry to hear that im sure she loves you or why else would you still be living with her if you just went over to visit im unsure why youd put your self threw that;strong
in the exact same boat my ex just left me because of my depression and i had told her how i had attempted before but had those thoughts since which was like 4 years ago but she freaked out and constantly kept thinking i was going to do something and now i never wanna tell people about any of my depression problems again;no
im really sorry for this im going through something similar and i have pretty much given up all hope that i am the same as my peers i am definitely not i feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself everyday is a day where i am buffeted by my own worthlessness i try my best i do i try my very best to get through every day is a drag but at least its a drag and not a standstill after a while i forget people exist really its just me and my depression i dont need any more love from my peers after some time;strong
sorry its hard i hated it;weak
you are seen we care about you here its not always a booming because everyone is so sad themselves but we look out for eachother here;weak
true in a way that can be used as a copout life  people have continuously treated you worse than shit and you developed depression because of it  must have caught a bug somewhere  depression is complex and the causes vary greatly;no
if you were here i would hug you right now;strong
i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong
the possibile outcomes of trying to fix everything that went wrong if i cant ill kill myself and if i can over 50 of it then ill live i havent tried yet but im gonna try it soon;no
ive been that way since a toddler never wanted to go outside if it was sunnyonly at night or on cloudy days still avoid sunlight to an unhealthy degree haha my folks joke about how pale i am  im seeing now that sunlight avoidance seems to be a common thread w depressed folks at least in this sub odd since light therapy is a proven treatment for improving mood i get horribly depressed every spring so i feel like my brain is wired backward;no
really depressed right now and i feel like it helps me been drunk that past 56 days and as soon as i sober up i feel like i do anything  i suppose the hangovers make it worse for a few days but when drunk worth not feeling as bad as i do when not drinking i stand being sober and dealing with my thoughts a bad cycle but i like to drink until my life kinda brightens up a little bit that way easier to be hungover;no
why the heck do we hate ourselves man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else sorry to get weird there it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves anyway i have one scar on my arm from one time that i tried that and there forever it still makes me sad when i see it so sorry for what pain you are in there will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself amp the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face;strong
what is going on how long have you been thinking about this maybe we should talk about it first and think through some stuff;weak
yeah how i wish i had a good job to support my parents how i wish i had a place on my own to focus on relationships how i wish i was my loveinterests focus so yeah most things dont come out as planed here either;no
not to sound harsh here but do you have medical training you shouldnt be diagnosing yourself there are plenty of professionals who can do that for you and provide any help you may need;no
i hope it turns out better than expected ;weak
hey there you seem to be going through something care to share;weak
beautiful i wish i could help you feel better i would even offer a bed with me but unfortunately your irish self isnt near me i hope you can get a new one soon i can just picture you in a nice big 4 poster bed with curtains;weak
i personally dont but i can understand it i can understand it down to my core;weak
yeah i have gone numb to life while sober and spend my high regretting getting high when that happens i get even higher to drown out life;no
like standing behind a glass wall with all of your dreams ahead of you i know how it feels;weak
misery loves companyi just moved to a new state a month ago quit my job left my family the only friends i have right now are my landlady and realtor its really fucking shitty some days hang there if you can;weak
what do you feel is bringing on said troubling thoughts;no
chill man high school isnt that bad all you have to do is just be chill and if you dont want to talk to anyone thats fine but eventually someone will want to talk to you thats just how it is ;strong
good luck dont you have any friends in school by the way;weak
i had this perception for a long time myself but i realized eventually its because i wasnt reaching out to them myself im here and i havent forgotten about you im here to help ;weak
i cant and i feel like a failure because of it it has been extrodinarily hard for me to hold a job and i became homeless long term because of it i still cant function like a normal productive citizen despite going back to work numerous times its even harder when the peoppe around you judge im 31 now and most of my peers have their own houses by now its so agonizing for me even though i am happy for them ill keep trying to get myself back though im sorry youre going through this op;strong
what makes you think youre a shitty human being i dont know who you are and i dont know your story so pardon me if im coming as rude by saying this that is not my intention im solely trying to help but maybe some of those reasons arent founded for example i often worry that all the people i love will abandon me and even though its not really founded and i know in the back of my head that it probably wont happen it is still one of my largest fears;no
yeah also feel numb often wanna talk about it;weak
it wont kill you definitely you should be fine but its still harmful i would recommend visiting the hospital especially if you feel bad stay safe anyway wish you all the best;weak
whats up buddy  want to talk ;weak
maybe youre going through an existential crisis have you ever thought what the meaning of your life is;no
i feel the same im sorry;strong
is anyone home you can talk to has anything happened in your life recently if feeling really sadhopeless and it persists or has persisted for a while now talk to someone about it i hope you feel better soon i know it sucks horribly going through that;weak
i feel youre pain op when it comes to texting holding a conversation is like rocket science;weak
well i sincerely hope you have a good time;weak
hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong
currently no but 12 days ago i drank until i blacked out just trying to forget my feelings and forget everything until morning my subconscious drunk brain had other plans i tried to hang myself from a bridge but luckily was too drunk to execute it i ended up with broken bones in both my feet a required 5 day stay in a hospital behavior and addiction unit and no memory of what i had done or even ever feeling suicidal 12 days sober and have accepted that i have a binge drinking problem you can only drown your sorrows for so long before they explode outward  one way or another i am happy to help any way i can;weak
well i can say that i think its really good that it gets better throughout the day for me its the opposite my mornings are bleh as the day goes on into the night i feel better and before bed time i feel depressed i think everyone is just different and maybe getting your day started gets rid of some mental worries and anticipation;weak
how will you fuck people over;no
i know this feeling it sucks so hard you should try meditating like breath 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out for a long time and you will feel a bit better;weak
i want to give it all;no
depends what you mean by get caught someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if youre under 18 parents can take you to a hospital basic detainment is 72 hours 3 days to ensure youre not a harm to yourself or others during that time they examine you and see your mental state if at the end youre not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment if you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment now say you made an attempt and go to the er for something they cant always just detain you ive been to the er for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication longest i was there was a few hours due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than i wanted to be there i got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home there is a ton a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness be informed do real research isnt google you are smart enough to do real research dont just ask strangers online for all the answers also get help;no
i want to repeat other comments but do it there is nothing afterwards this is your one chance and you have to make it count life is like a train ride there are turns twists hills curves but sometimes there are tunnels and when your in the tunnel for a while you look back and forward but see nothing but darkness it feels like it is all that is has been and will be but tunnels always have an end this train ride of life will get you where you want to go as long as you get off early;weak
start with finding a jobcareer that sounds interesting and look into it;no
posting this you are looking for a friwnd well i have not much to offer you but a chat you want to be my friend;weak
talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
i have been at a similar point to you where i had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest even when aspects in my life have improved i still struggle with it frequently i have done many things in life i regret and feel like ive fucked up a lot of situations relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life it took me a long time to understand that i cant go back in time and fix anything it is fucking terrifying to feel like youve messed your life up but please trust me when i say that its ok to fuck up you are human we all are i have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless i am if you have someone you trust to talk to please dont be afraid to rant or reach out to them my inbox is always open too if you need a stranger to listen youre not alone in this;weak

being alone is terrible im sorry youre alone if i hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there then i suggest doing just about anything different anything really break your horrible lonely routine the only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change what can you do differently tomorrow;strong

i feel like this every day then something happens like a stupid comment and i am reminded that no one actually cares its all a facade ive even started paying people to care like going to the hair dresser to get a wash and cut even though i dont need one or going to the chiropractor even though it doesnt help but for 15 minutes its almost like someone cares;no

youa re comdemned to a life of freedom is an old quote i tihnk its from satre but im not sure and later there has been others who disagree you are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses and that oftens leads to the question why am i alive not only that you are forced into not just a world but a particular part of the word which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty and for some people this works out well if you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it enjoy it and love it if you can find shelter food sleep joy love and challenge in you enviroment but for some of us we dont fin those things we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature you first statement i cannot say is wrong you didnt decide to exist but netiher did you chose not to and existing in of itself is not evil or good but if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful then a there are options available the first thing no matter how you want to change your context for the better rquires that you step back and see the context where are you from what values have been impsoed on you which makes sense to you which doesnt how has these values been imposed who has impsoed them for these purposes your reasoning is a great tool it easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame but you really have to map it out and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it and then find the conflicts with your nature the pain and sadness then you have to figure out a plan and this is a tremendous task not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you you have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself and then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life alkohol amkes me miserable and everyone i know drinks find people you can exist with with out alcohol my father is violent create an existence were you are independant from him school is terrible translate my class mates bully me daily find another school thes are simple i know and jsut examples now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you but the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature essence and existence and a way to improve it when you ask why reason is not a tool that can answer its like trying to build a ship using lead sure maybe it can be done but its deffinately not the best way refelection abstract thought contemplation emotion empathy those are the tools to arrive at an answer if reason was used human life wouldnt really have value if you were the head of state and only used reason you would quickly realize human lives are not what drives you foward what makes progress and creates a super power and lives could turn into numbers sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population but only if they are educated or strong using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers you have to work hard right now because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it and you deserve to be your best you and if you dont liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself then there are options but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions it is hard to change your enviroment you have to stay alive becuase you know a humans life has worth and you are one when you see another in pain you wish he wouldnt ahve to be when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try you have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self stay strong friend love i wish i speleld better;weak

sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong

you could always leave them and find your own indipendence sorrounding yourself with the people you love which are not part of your family idk your situation actually but i felt the same way too many times so lonely and neglected by the ones that should care the most it happens but this perception is not necessary the truth killing yourself wont solve or change anything;weak
talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
sorry you are feeling that way but how do you know it was a lie in my experience most people dont compliment unless they meant it excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course who complimented you and in what context;strong

i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong

sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong

hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong

i can agree with every single thing you have listed there and experience them all it is not normal for a 24 year old good looking well educated man to be feeling this way  but i have never felt right in life the biggest thing that kills me is that i have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life i find myself completely and utterly alone every day my only communication is with my clients by email i do leave the house but its only to go to the grocery store or for a walk  by myself of course i read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that id love to visit but i can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all just sick of it;weak

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong

yes so sorry thats happening to you but it feels good to relate  i see a lot of posts about having great dreams i have at least one bad dream almost every night  and the feeling always bleeds into my day especially if it was confusing or made me question reality i have dreams all the time about my little sisters getting hurt and it makes me worry for them just today i had some kind of sleep paralysis i dont know if thats the right word i looked it up but it didnt seem to fit and honestly im scared to fall asleep tonight because i do not want it to happen again its happened several times and it terrifies me youre not alone friend;strong
i know if this is comforting but there is no reason why you just were born i get the same thought as you often i think of how there is much more net suffering than net joy in life but honestly it just feels that way since been more severely depressed just a couple of months i have hope that at some point i can get back to feeling better it may take a few more months even but even just thinking back to how i used to feel makes me realize that there is hope;no

wow looking through your post history makes this hit even harder ;no
thats a pretty profound question but i think happiness is something that a lot of people dont understand in a period or prolonged period of despair i dont believe there can be happiness at all and its only after that period has been solved over attacked enough by effort and time that you can start experiencing happiness i dont think happiness and gratitude should be forced or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy im still going through that period and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way but they are fleeting and leave very quickly the whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories think about it which memories are the quickest strongest and most easily able to be remembered for you the most emotional ones if your most emotional memories are negative you will be in despair on the converse if ones most emotional memories are positive you will be in a state of happiness there is a way to end your despair you just have to face it head on and let go of everything and keep trying to let go and accept very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole;weak

do your parents tell you that youre a failure my mom and dad both did that to me for a while im 16 i used to be depressed over my bad grades and i had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and i would amount to nothing then all of a sudden one day i noticed that bad grades in high school arent the end of the world it might have been because i moved out of my dads place and i didnt have to hear him call me a failure anymore either way i became happy again then i met her a nice girl who was my age she had a pretty face we had a ton of classes together and she thought i was really funny i was able to open up to her i think i know i fell in love with her she had a boyfriend though hes a shitty person hes high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls i really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and id be the happiest guy in the world that didnt happen i became desperate i began to have a drinking problem because of it one night while very drunk i texted her a bunch of things about my depression i dont think she cares about me anymore now i find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how i let myself get depressed again  basically what i wanna say to you is your lifes not over its just beginning whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome just focus on you and dont let other people get in your way and bring you down like i did dont let anyone else determine your happiness control your life you can do it;weak

i was on a very low dose of celexa only 10mg but that was causing enormous weight gain im really short and i was gaining a pound a month i tapered off quickly on the expectation that the mental pain of getting fat this quickly was going to counteract any benefit from the drug i went off and im on gabapentin now and melatonin and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay i used to tell myself meds were a weakness but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job which was in the cards if i hadnt gone to see a therapist i know it feels shameful but really its no different than needing glasses or a coat when its cold if your current meds help you stay on them and dont feel bad about it;weak
dude i dont know if itll help but as someone who has thought about suicide i know how much it can suck so if you want to talk about it;weak
remember that eventually you wont cry and that you woke up today to experience another day of life maybe it wasnt the best day but tomorrow is a brand new one and its going to be ok whether im talking about tomorrow or in an hour or a week it will be ok im really sorry you are feeling down;strong

cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly please use a sterile blade if youre going to cut yourself and dont go any deeper than just the surface skin take it from me as someone who has used selfharm an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief i also recommend other methods there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far far safer than cutting are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water boiling water shouldnt be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds on the other end of the scale i found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as i could helped i thought it would just make my hand feel numb but it creates a localised sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me;no
you asking for reasons is the biggest reason of all;no
yea sorry i know how you feel feeling very alone today;strong
sorry to hear that man what are you studying do you feel like the material you are studying is hard or is the volume of the work too much;strong

wait does this mean youre seeing someone already i can see the concern but if youre already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isnt really better you can always look for a second opinion im getting help but before i was and while i was trying to find the right combo of things id have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently like 45 days out of a week it sucked hard right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week sometimes i make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself even if its not actually enjoyable this combo sucks and i hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern;weak
in there my friend im here for you;weak
not alone pm me if you ever need someone to chat;weak

im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong

thanks for sharing that i agree that telling people that they shouldnt kill themselves due to their loved ones can sometimes be futile and useless you must be going through so much with the world being unready to accept you yet just know there are people who do accept you for who you are whether its the friend that lives far away from you or any person that read your post and identified with your story you staying alive and sharing this would also do wonders for trasgenders who have trouble being accepted by their families or close ones depression causes us to feel helpless and unloved slowly finding ways to treat yourself will give you more reasons to keep going there are transgender communities that you can also communicate with on the internet take care of yourself please;weak

when youre in the darkest part of a depressive hole it feels like you finally see the truth  that the problem is you and youre stuck with it but it does come in cycles i like to start small take control of whatever i can control is empowering it could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game or clearing out all the spam in your email or reorganising your room just find something to keep yourself moving writing can help too just lay it all out there seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking if its worse now then that means was better and it will be eventually think of someone you can talk to who knows you well and just hit them up and say hi maybe a text maybe an email just remind yourself that you are not alone its a shitty battle but stick it out if you can if you have a therapist try reaching out to one and if you dont then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one theres nothing magic about professional help but it does work sometimes and thats reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can send me pm if you want to vent more or anything youre not alone and you can survive this;weak
it probably depends on the state edit what state in the us being 14 you are going to be tethered to your parentguardian legally the therapistcounselorpsychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk for example i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation for self harm im not sure exactly howif the information would be disclosed by the therapistcounselorpsychologist to your parents but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a great extent then yes it would most likely be disclosed im 18 now and started seeing my oncampusuniversity therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year where i was 17 it sucks not being in control of your life but what can you do you know if getting to see a therapist is an issue i would recommend asking to talk to your doctorpediatrician in private during a normal checkup and say tht youve had symptoms of depressionanxiety and youd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help if its not an issue of talking to your parentguardian then whats the worry if you cant see a doctor a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent or even a supportive teacher that you trust i went through a very similar situation when i was younger and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it it mght not go away and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age its really hard to deal with all this emotional baggage everyone deserves to feel the best that they can you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont feel free to pm me id be happy to be your penpal through all this lt3;weak

i think people are meant to regularly bathe like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting i wasnt raised the best one thing is that i was never taught to bathe regularly it was normal to bathe once every 24 weeks growing up basically i never had it ingrained into me which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods so during these periods i would go as long as i could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything i did usually 46 weeks my dirtiness would get into my eyes and they would burn like hell i got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin in grown hairs dry scaly skin acne etc my hair had issues too unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff my dick had some infection and itched like hell i also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse i would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me for example i also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty and i smelled bad but luckily i dont have volatile bo anyways just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that i wish someone told me about thanks mom;no

it is a sector in boom right now there are tons of jobs and its only growing you will have no problem finding a job whatsoever however i understand your worry is money even after you get a job keep looking and applying the more experience you have the better you can probably find jobs that pay higher and higher idk how far youre in right now through your course but if its not too late try taking some security courses as well while it is in a boom having security courses on your resume would almost guarantee that you will always have a job literally every company needs help with security and theyre will to pay lots of money to find it everything will be fine;weak

im in a somewhat similar position i love my bf more than anything but my family issues and a big issue with a dog of mine is causing him to be depressed and not enjoy his life the way he should be he tells me this i solved the family issue but the only way to solve to dog issue involves me putting him down and i cant do it i just cant im starting to think my only other option is just to leave him so he can fully enjoy his life the way he deserves to n the thought of not being with him makes me want to die its devastating i know what youre going through im bouncing between anxiety and depression i guess i should just leave though;no

yeah man you want to sleep and not wake up right;no
yeah this feeling is a strong one felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood the truth is that i never dealt with it constructively or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling part of the reason i think you and i are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively in my case i used constant denial and selfnumbing  at some point i just assumed the pit was a part of me i could choose to ignore you seem to be actively trying to experience it you are engaging your sadness which is objectively good for working through depression it may not be what you might call conventional but everyone does their thing a little differently  if what you are doing no longer works for you though it might be best to start looking for other healthy ways of working through that discomfort personally when i feel that pit i know what thoughts tend to follow it fortunately my therapists and my stay at hospital helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard in order to redirect those thoughts that create it i try to reach out to anyone in my support net its hard because i feel like they wont give a shit but most of the time they do but i often choose to ignore that reality or i will simply write some positive words here on this reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others but for my own sake as well as you put so well giving that pit a purpose but dont cover that feeling up continue to engage with it as best as you can its there for a reason hopefully the more you work with it the easier it is to process and let go;weak

sorry man if people judge you for it then fuck them;strong
acceptance ive been dealing with it for quite a while now its really easier said than done but after realizing you cannot change objective reality it gets easier i find comfort in the fact we truly know nothing meaning perhaps there is more to our observable reality than we can sense i doubt this however at least we have been dead before and its not something entirely too new;no
what does that mean in practice are you one of those persons who got tired of being used so now you use others;no

know the feeling my friends are married they have kids have homes of their own meanwhile im still at home with my parents wondering what the fuck happened to my life at 31 but as others have said facebook is pretty much a crock of shit i recently decided to out myself for being the manic depressive i am some people were kind about it others pretended they gave a shit more likely for the look how sympathetic i am play card recently ive been pretty out with my highs and lows my highs get a lot of love but as soon as i show my lows i notice a massive difference in support its almost like they go out of their way to avoid the lows and reality of it so yeah facebook is pretty much a crock of shit and it really does expose to you who people really are;weak

hi talk2muchaa lik onus111 suggested feeling like doing something just does not happen if youre deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life you just need to force yourself to do it  thats the sad reality of it however that doesnt mean that there arent ways to make forcing yourself easier on your mind and less stressful if you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year you will have a house you cant punish yourself for not building rome in a day you will go on twitch and see streamers who are making millions youtubers who are making millions i mean fuck pewdiepie has 56 million subscribers but that shit didnt happen in just one day you need to break shit up into increments perhaps others dont have to do this but its the only way ive found to get anything done if you want to learn a language go on duolingo set a 10 points per day challenge yes its jackshit in terms of work it takes literally 2 minutes a day but its something try and ignore your brain saying increase the goal to 50 a day were getting fuckall done because this will break your discipline and youll go back to 0 a day consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days burning out and stopping altogether the key to beating depressioninduced laziness is tiny incremental steps for example im learning calculus on khan academy one lesson a day thats right the average khan video is around 10 minutes i do one video a day i am slowly but consistently learning each day i go over the notes from the previous day the problem isnt volume its consistency;no
is it an alarm problem or a i dont want to go so i just go back to sleep because fuck it whats the point in going problem most campuses offer free counseling so if youre concerned that this is a personal issue i would check that out;no
good morning bro im happy that you woke up and read this comment i hope you have a great day today;strong
i dont want to be here either after 25 years of this bullshit 4 suicide attempts later though ive realised that nonsense im here if i like it or not and you are too the reason were both still here is because something is keeping us here you may not know what the fuck that is yet cause i sure as fuck didnt but with time you really will it may be to keep watch over delicate friends it may be to provide entertainment by being a funny motherfucker it might be there because youre a genius that doesnt know how to communicate with the rest of us idiots my point is youre clearly an intelligent person that struggles with emotional bombardment and treat it like that suicide isnt as easy as people say it takes real guts and my 4 times were a cry for help i know people that have gone the full way so ffs find something in you that you do actually like fuck what other people think and press forward my friend youve got it in you;weak
i have very bad social anxiety its the reason why im depressed actually every single day even a simple interaction with someone can make me feel sad i worry about stupid shit like did i say bye to a friend the right way stuff like that and just being a severely shy person is making me feel i wont be able to get anywhere in life im nearly 16 so it might not seem like something i need to worry about but it seems everyone else around me has everything sorted out all my friends have partners a job and are pretty confident in themselves but with me having none of those things i feel like the only place my life is going is living with my parents until i spiral into a deeper depression and probably take my life;no
nothing will change until you change still struggling every minute and every second with this too so right there with you everything is shit until you see it differently just imagine the you whose conquered this hell in your mind what do you think he would tell you;no
as that was your first ever boyfriend i understand you missing him if i ever get a first girlfriend i would miss her too however this guy did terrible things to you there are other guys out there who will love you and treat you with respect good luck;weak

maybe you can find a room mate or something  idk what type of housing you live in eg apt house renting etc but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if thats something youre looking for maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes people can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals in some cases they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed sometimes its easy to focus on the negative of living alone but there are tons of good things about it as well you just gotta look towards those as well;no
this doubly so the first part should be in bold letters on this sub;no
are you putting forth the sacrifice needed to change such have you identified if you would sooner live a lie or live a truth ask a blunt person the truth life is inherently a horrible experience covered up by meaningless stimulations that give the illusion of better a bandage on the mortal wound of monotony and uselessness how many people have you met that make you feel better how many things in your life bring you outside the feeling of depression for me there is nothing i am a dirty old man white with red hair and bad teeth i am despised and loathed by ninety percent of the population people actively move out of my vicinity as if my very being is a contagion they might contract the people who dont actively run are despicable lunatics selfish and narcissistic beyond redemption woe woe is me;no
im sorry this is true for me as well and they regularly remind me i think we can get through it though actually thats a lie i hope you can get through it im not going to be able too;strong

sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong

im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong
yeah unfortunately the side effects from them can be really strong especially if its your first time trying them i lost a lot of sleep from stomach pains when i was first prescribed them that said they sideeffects should pass fairly quickly as your body adapts to the meds but if it is causing you a serious problem talk to your doctor they can often start you off on a smaller dosage and work their way up to a level that can help you;no
happy birthday i hope you do something fun after work;weak

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong

does it hurt more than cutting;no
people who give that advice probably have those things working for them but they dont realize that none of it helps depression being outdoors just makes me feel lonely as hell and without companionship and if youre depressed a hobby cant help you out either because if you have no drive to do anything a hobby cannot satiate what youre truly desiring just try going after what you truly desire and chip away at it;no
yes at the weekend i try to do everything i need to do when i wake up as always get depressed in the evenings;no
i feel the same i know they the pills made to make you happy but doing therapy once or twice a week taking two kinds of meds and still feel like i would be totally happy staying in my room alone for forever i know why i should even try i also feel weird asking for more meds but i think i have to;no

youre a good man median i hope you know this i hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations but id rather you live personally;weak
thats great op the first step in overcoming the depression and the shitty feelings is being ready to ask for help talking can be very helpful and sometimes it feels good to let your feelings out how are you doing today;weak
every day depression dulls your physical emotions on the inside i may be screaming and balling my eyes out but i physically let it out when i try the only times i cry are when i have an extremely deep thought that hits me hard and ball out of nowhere for literally 5 seconds before i pull myself together another 5 seconds later like nothing even happened;no
lol thats an idea that lilterally comes up every time i take a breath ;no
its true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon weve gone very far into the illusions of separation and its going to take some time to break through these but its going to happen i have no doubt anymore im sending you love and hugs through the wire even if its only designed for 0 and 1 feel it;strong

i got really negative and lazy about life i wasnt motivated to go to school and do my exams and i would stay up most nights with insomnia i always assumed i was lazy but i went into job seeking being optimistic and that quickly drove me to an attempted suicide  thats about when i realised for most people its an overwhelming experience of emotions and negative thoughts about themselves but depression comes in very different shapes and sizes;no
im not afraid to enjoy things  but  im afraid to stress myself by having expectations of great times or great results from things i plan i try not to expect anything at all  because if im disappointed it could drop me waaaaaaay down;no
sorry man if people judge you for it then fuck them;strong
wish and hope work sorry sorry just brutal done everything you have to try again fail forward they say yes it sucks i know;no
youre not evaluating yourself or being overly critical of your personality theres no feelings of anxiety or any bipolar fluctuations of emotions in fact zero emotion just peaceful not happy not sad no neurotic thinking or urgency to evaluate every thought going through the mind basically you dont take yourself or life so personally or too seriously you feel light not heavy you have expectations and desires in life but you dont overly invest your mind and emotion in them youre justcool even keeled;no
not sure if this is much help but someone once told me if you keep dancing with the devil youll still feel like youre in hell good luck friend;weak

yes i distinctly remember being very happy until people started bullying me for being gay the feelings of emptiness and shame closed me off from normal development and have never left despite years of therapy this eventually turned into chronic depression and failed relationships straight men who proudly make gay jokes as if its some disgusting or abnormal thing to be avoided and mocked while they feel open and free to express their own sexual experiences have blood on their hands;no

yes so sorry thats happening to you but it feels good to relate  i see a lot of posts about having great dreams i have at least one bad dream almost every night  and the feeling always bleeds into my day especially if it was confusing or made me question reality i have dreams all the time about my little sisters getting hurt and it makes me worry for them just today i had some kind of sleep paralysis i dont know if thats the right word i looked it up but it didnt seem to fit and honestly im scared to fall asleep tonight because i do not want it to happen again its happened several times and it terrifies me youre not alone friend;strong

i ran a business for 7 years you cannot believe the stress it is you absolutely must have all your ducks in a row before you run a business your ego gets caught up in it so when it is having rough times you feel like crap and when its doing well you need to use that to prepare for when it inevitably isnt it can be done but its expensive in terms of money your sanity health and any relationships that might otherwise happen however unlikely i wish i never tried myself;no
im really sorry for this im going through something similar and i have pretty much given up all hope that i am the same as my peers i am definitely not i feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself everyday is a day where i am buffeted by my own worthlessness i try my best i do i try my very best to get through every day is a drag but at least its a drag and not a standstill after a while i forget people exist really its just me and my depression i dont need any more love from my peers after some time;strong

saw mine coming a mile away suffering from anxiety and depression and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult job was going to shit and stressing me out money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night one day it became too much started crying and having a panic attack didnt stop until i drank myself to sleep the next day i was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed that was three years ago;no
i dont know if i know exactly ive had feelings of contentment and i guess warm feelings but i think its more than that i think the best way is to sometimes look at yourself like you are a close friend and treat yourself accordingly because actions make a huge impact and if you do things like removing yourself from unnecessary stressful situations and not committing selfsabotage me sometimes lol the road gets a little brighter may you walk on warm sands traveler;weak
brilliant i sat here and mulled it over i really like it;no
i know we all hope for that but at the same time we all hope for better days maybe theyre coming maybe not but please dont do anything permanent if you ever want to talk im here almost all the time;weak
sorry to hear that feel free to pm if you want to;strong
thats totally normal most people get that from time to time it will pass the when is the real question good news is you can work on the when at least it works for me i think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling not fight it and not try to change it even try to get yourself to cry the point is really to change your mindset from i have depression i cant cure it it is killing me to im sad again for no reason human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell im gonny cry all day to give it what it wants;weak
im sorry you have no one to talk to;strong
well that was a nice idea of your stepmoms im sorry it didnt helpive read that massage helps people recovering from eds with body image but maybe it takes a couple sessions hang in there;strong
depression is a hard fight i am 29 on meds and i still struggle all i can add is to start with yourself keep a daily routine like hygiene or reading find something that allows you to clear your mind and be calm go to work or go to school and be yourself always find something that can make you laugh a great sense of humor and a good personality can for real change the way people see you i had terrible acne as a child and hated how i looked but as i grew older i gained more friends through my humor i only really have 2 friends but they are great friends quality over quantity and all that jazz as for being single i too am in the double digit bus i go from periods of loathing being alone to being numb to being okay with it my friends and the things that make me laugh help ease that pain;no
im sorry that youre also in this position im honestly just waiting for my parents to die so i can kill myself;strong

hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong
it is its very tough to keep going i cant tell you how to make it stop i wish i could i just try to focus on the next very small thing i can do im sorry dude you arent alone i promise;strong

i feel you there and i am so sorry those people suck;strong
sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out it lets you feel powerful in control of things in therapy they teach you to sitdown often and sort through your emotions what emotion are you experiencing right now how do you identify it what caused you to feel like this what steps can you make to prevent this feeling try to walk yourself through some of these exercises they might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future;strong
you are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and i think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings im sorry i couldnt help more and hope you get better;strong
yeah were creatures of habit unfortunately i also find myself falling into the same pits over and over again but yknow what sometimes life just clicks together and all the pieces fit into the big picture and you find that moment where you can change it doesnt have to be overnight but look for some baby steps that can put your forward best of luck x;weak
hey i have no problem staying awake a little longer up to talk;weak
so fucking true nobody does;weak
meh life is what you make of it and that can either be very scary or quite comforting personally i am at a point where i feel circumstantially helpless and genetically inferior so i am hopeless but tbh everything is about your perspective and what you choose to focus your attention on if you have the mental stregnth to seek help get on medication pursue interests you like and meet people through them and accept your reality than maybe just maybe you can get better life is in my opinion just a series of accomplishments experiences relationships and habits you need to have a groove and stick with it firstly just be happy with yourself you gotta do anything to make yourself like your own company and brain become your own best friend;no
im sorry you are feeling this way we are here for you;strong
wait you got fired due your depression where are you from isnt depression classified as a medical condition like any other arent you protected by law against such action sorry to read about your situation and sorry for all the questions guilty of being a lawyer ;strong
happy birthday my dude definitely get better i promise;weak
sometimes the people who care are the ones you least expect talk to someone who you trust alot and tell them everything sometimes advice from someone you know personally has more impact then someone from the internet all you can really do is talk it it and if it gets worse go to a doctor hope i helped a bit kyle;weak
woah thats accurate the posts in this sub today really reflect me this is very truthful i just live with it;strong
sorry feeling so stressed right now op do you want to talk more about your making you so stressed;strong

listen m8 a dead man is a free man when you are dying the world is your oyster do whatever;no
average is great at least you dont suck;weak
its a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy and one by one those things get taken from you what i try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right ie something that costs money makes you happy but you dont make enough money need a way to make more money dedicate all free time to applying for better work or feel lonely and havent got anybody need to find somebody to stop feeling like that need to know best places to find somebody research ways to meet people and put self into that situation or feel worthless being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you and you can feel needed honestly i know its not that easy a fix and there will be more bumps to overcome one of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness and even having looked at places to go i still havent found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people but generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable even just through reading online about how to get started can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it wont be like that forever and that there is a physical tangible mortal way to deal with the situation so i would recommend pick a small goal that can lead to some form of happiness and work towards that rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap helps you take it day by day a little easier and i hope that would make each new day if not better at least consistent for you feel better soon bud;weak
none of that fucking works anyone who thinks it does doesnt understand depression or what anyone here is going through the only time it works is if it is a genuine expression of love and care from someone important to you not this generic bullshit that you get fed every other day;weak
please dont its just not right choice make there is always something that can be done other than that;strong
im sorry for however long you still have to deal with them but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to and that is 100 okay you are your own very awesome person and they dont get a say in who you are;strong

sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong
have you looked into therapy;no

mostly video games keeps my negative thoughts away pretty well music i try to avoid because when im in those kind of hard times i tend to listen to music that i can relate to so it kind of brings more of the feelings to the surface memes are funny i guess masturbation is short term yeah video games;no
sometimes we need to start with ourselves do you think you provide yourself with the care you need it is alright to lose care for things and people at times because that only tells us that we might need to look out for ourselves first;weak
so sorry you are going through this my mom died when i was 21 its a traumatizing experience i hope you have a supportive family my family was only my mom and sisters at that time dont kill your self your dad would not want that get help even if you dont feel like living right now it does get better;strong
music had always affected my moods depending on what i listen to when i need a boost of happiness or motivation i like to listen to alexander desplat or hans zimmer or james horner honestly i am just a huge orchestra person and since it doesnt have lyrics i can pretend its the soundtrack to my life and feel more courageous to get moving theres also another user i wish i could remember where or who it was but they suggested doing at least one thing whenever you get up to go pee or get water then you can push it to doing two things when you feel more motivated please be kind and have patience with yourself depression is an ongoing war with many battles celebrate your wins and dont berate yourself when youre not doing as well as you wish take baby steps you can easily accomplish and grow from there i hope you have a great day tomorrow and if you ever need some support just send me a pm hugs in the meantime;weak

just because you feel like youre headed in that direction doesnt mean you actually areand if you are you can always turn the car around youre the only one who controls the ride and where it goes ive had many days and i still have those days where ive lost hope in life feel like there is no point to go on because no matter how much i try to get things on track i fail that no one cares about me and if i were gone the whole world would have one less body to deal with but then i realize that these things are not permanent or untrue and if i am not happy i can change itbut you can not change suicide try to take a step back and think about what brings you joy in your life currently and think of the things youve enjoyed while growing up and surround yourself with them try something new that youve always wished youd try these are all steps to a better life one thats happierand is definitely possible to achieve it takes some time and work but in the end it is worth it dont give up the best things in life are always the ones that make you work the hardest for feeling like this is not permanent its only temporary you have many people who care for you who i am quite certain will notice if youre gone and would be devastated not to mention the hundreds of other people youre robbing from the chance of getting to meet someone as amazing as you too stay strong and remember that it will always be okay life is what you make it;weak
my current goal is to outlive everyone that cares about me it seems like the nicest thing i can do for them and it also grants me a chance to figure stuff out all of my selfpreservation instincts are driven off of the pain i would cause loved ones if something were to happen to me in all situations and that fear is what keeps me going during the worst of it if you cant do it for yourself try to carry on for someone you care about;no

maybe you can read for your exam while in bed have you wondered about why that is that you cant get out of bed or have you just accepted it as reality maybe youre not feeling like getting up and showering and stuff having to change clothes and eventually throw the pile of used clothes in the washer i know the feeling though cant be sure thats what youre worried about maybe its about meeting people people can be stupid demanding and stuff sometimes even friends can feel like a burden to some people doesnt mean they hate their friends it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity youre addicted to it just like people being addicted to video games it makes you feel good to just lie there as opposed to everything else when you leave it you suffer withdrawals in that case your best bet is to force yourself for three weeks i know its hard but thats literally the only way to change it you can get someone to help you do it if you have friends nearby that can knock on your door and be mean to you for a few weeks can you tell me more about your experience lying in bed what you feel what your thoughts are about not lying in bed;no

i can agree with every single thing you have listed there and experience them all it is not normal for a 24 year old good looking well educated man to be feeling this way  but i have never felt right in life the biggest thing that kills me is that i have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life i find myself completely and utterly alone every day my only communication is with my clients by email i do leave the house but its only to go to the grocery store or for a walk  by myself of course i read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that id love to visit but i can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all just sick of it;weak

i was on lexapro and wellbutrin for the longest time and didnt have any bad side effects but it definitely didnt help me as much as id hoped it did get me from i cant leave my bed to i guess i can function occasionally on a good day im no longer on the lexapro but the wellbutrin has stuck with me for a while so it went well for me hope it goes well for you;weak
tell him to get some professional help do your best to offer support but regardless of your relationship with them it is not your job to heal them they can only do that for themselves and thats something he will have to choose for himself start making appointments with well rated professionals now it often takes time to schedule them good luck to you and your friend;weak
its not uncommon bipolar can be very difficult to diagnose we tend to think of it as a constant swinging between high and low but really you can be low all the time and still be bipolar if you had one high at some point what you do is move forward with your new diagnosis and work on treatment and coping skills adhd and depression are generally easier to manage long term than bipolar disorder so thats a plus;no

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
dont do it tell me your story id love to hear;weak
sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong

i hope it gets better for you just remember to take care of yourself while you are depressed what do you tell people to do when they are sick with the flu you tell them to drink water get plenty of rest dont overexert and eat bland foods drink tea medicine whatever this is recommended for the most rapid recovery if they neglect this advice they run the risk of getting sicker what do you tell someone who is sick with depression just do your best to keep up with life make sure you eat make sure you sleep brush your teeth do whatever chores you would normally do try not to turn to any vice or addiction and avoid isolating yourself if you upkeep with life you are more likely to see a faster recovery if you fail to upkeep you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed you are strong and you got this best of luck to you;weak

yeah this feeling is a strong one felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood the truth is that i never dealt with it constructively or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling part of the reason i think you and i are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively in my case i used constant denial and selfnumbing  at some point i just assumed the pit was a part of me i could choose to ignore you seem to be actively trying to experience it you are engaging your sadness which is objectively good for working through depression it may not be what you might call conventional but everyone does their thing a little differently  if what you are doing no longer works for you though it might be best to start looking for other healthy ways of working through that discomfort personally when i feel that pit i know what thoughts tend to follow it fortunately my therapists and my stay at hospital helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard in order to redirect those thoughts that create it i try to reach out to anyone in my support net its hard because i feel like they wont give a shit but most of the time they do but i often choose to ignore that reality or i will simply write some positive words here on this reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others but for my own sake as well as you put so well giving that pit a purpose but dont cover that feeling up continue to engage with it as best as you can its there for a reason hopefully the more you work with it the easier it is to process and let go;weak

i can tell you this much if you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference then id say that its worth enduring the negative side effects as a side note i feel like ive heard ofknown people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them but its probably different from person to person i have no idea what the future holds for you and theres probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication so good luck;weak

yes right so my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me i will be better once through it so the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time see to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical take some time out and just breathe and let the shit goyou got this you are right nowliterally and i want to fall into those emotions and spread the way i feel everywhere i want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way but we because we have been here before and got through itand we were happy againand bam we are here now but we will be happy again you know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lollike for real that is the break throughrealizing that it fucking sucks sometimes so what supposed toobecause that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha i hope you feel better all i wish for you;weak
sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong

i looked at your post historysorry im nosy and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls dont find you attractive the key there was you said you dont even bother talking to them a fear of rejection is what keeps most people single i think even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better if she gives you that what do you want weirdo look thats her insecurity and those arent the kind of people you want in your life anyways beauty is in the eyes of the beholder my problem is the opposite im skinny as a rail and short upon putting myself out there i found that some people actually think im attractive youre your own worst critic so i sincerely doubt your just unlovably ugly and about your weight treat it like an rpg make a game of losing weight youll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose it can be kind of fun to work on yourself especially when you start to see results i was talking to my parents the other day and calorie counting apparently worked wonders on them do some research and see whats best for you im no doctor hope this helps;no
i was like this at 1618 all i wanted to do was sit in front of my computer and not leave the house it wasnt like i was actually doing anything productive but on youtube  games i was just rotting and completely ok with it because it stopped me feeling that deep void inside and the negative voice i am now 28 ive managed to find a little bit more of a balance between technology and life but i am still depressed and cycle in and out of this i would look into an addiction though it is possible to be addicted to electronics especially gaming and the internet if you feel like youre agitated and your depression is linked into computer usage you might want to consider that your depression and negativity is linked into an addiction;no

i think its real but not that all depressed people have it i think i have both an irrational pessimistic bias and a rational pessimistic bias my beliefs in pessimistic philosophies such as existential nihilism the right to die antinatalism veganism and disapproval of wild animal suffering are rationally justified i believe that im correct that life is pointless unnecessary and more painful than pleasurable i think that most people have an irrational optimism bias that makes them unaware of how awful the world really is;no

hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong
meditation helps to rewire the brain its how ive stayed med free with bipolar your brain starts to go for relaxation and calm instead of a default down feeling or thought but you have to keep doing it over and over even when it feels like its not working its not for everyone though mindfulness is a way of moving through life slowly for me finding little bits of joy in the smallest things like making and drinking a drink this is what got me out of bed in my darkest days;no

i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong

omg lol i 100 blame my parents after taking an ap psychology course at my school it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression i know i cant claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents the genetic aspects arent their fault of course but they are perfect human specimens so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process strangely being cognizant of that fact doesnt change it much of course ive directly told my parents i blame them for who i am and as perfect specimens they told me that i cant keep blaming them for everything theres truth to that of course but its rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility id better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim since theyre the ones who work and pay for my existence regardless of whether or not i can actually do jack shit about that child labor laws yo lol sorry your post is just so relatable i had to rant;strong

i can agree with every single thing you have listed there and experience them all it is not normal for a 24 year old good looking well educated man to be feeling this way  but i have never felt right in life the biggest thing that kills me is that i have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life i find myself completely and utterly alone every day my only communication is with my clients by email i do leave the house but its only to go to the grocery store or for a walk  by myself of course i read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that id love to visit but i can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all just sick of it;weak

nah man what youre saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at recognizing good art but get frustrated because their own art doesnt live up to the crazy high standard theyve set for themselves malcom gladwell suggests that it takes 10000 hours to gain mastery in something art is a skill just like anything else i think a lot of people get fooled into this you either have it or you dont mentality when it comes to creative arts its just not the case i think its more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at most people dont have that just keep practicing and never give up if you have the drive you will succeed eventually youll get better and better every day;weak

im very proud of you too remember the great feeling of success you have right now it will help you next time you have the urge;strong

whoa easy whoever she is and whatever you did chances are not as irreparable as you think time will heal most wounds and if it is really irreparable then you move on one incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad it might hurt to move on like really hurt but alright normal;weak
its fucking weird i often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends even though i know it will be good but once im there im often the life of the party or so i think i had people coming up to me greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other which was a year ago for the first and last time since i barely remembered their faces and not a single name so i guess i left an impression i really like to banter to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way i joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures im sarcastic sometimes even cynical and i joke a lot about myself mostly in a nonflattering way i think people like me in general i seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me but on the other hand as soon as i come home i feel a crushing void and i feel alone and that everything is pointless those feelings remain in my daytoday life and it starts to interfere with my work for example i am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where i spend most of my days and life in my boss already told me once in a pretty long phase of being really depressed that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if im in such mood i can be fun at work too i made my coworkers laugh on a lot f different occasions but that happens in good phases but there are very bad phases where i at best dont say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst i am filled with rage the whole day and cant contain it last week i was as close to quitting my job as i was never before maybe it would be best for all  whatever long story short i think i can be really funny too despite the fact i feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all;no
thats wonderful news you should be proud of that progress;weak
thing will only start looking up when you do its ok to feel down and hurt for a bit but dont let it consume you i briefly looked through your post history youre going through a break up its understandable i am also going through a break up and depression came with it you gave your heart to someone and expected them to so the same when they didnt you became devastated the truth is youre a loving caring compassionate kind person and deserves someone who wants you always it will work out things will get better but you have to try and make them better;weak
been on cit for a year it still leaves me feeling pretty tired its better when i take my dose at night rather than in the morning and any tiredness is worth the benefits of the drug in my case ;no
i was thinking the same thing like a minute ago its kinda reassuring to know i wont have the courage to take my own life but im scared at the thought of what if ill find the courage honestly;no
yes i have experienced that still do from time to time you are not alone;weak
hi there no one on this earth is worthless even if you feel that way now it gets better things change you will change i browsed through your post history and noticed how young you are the age youre in is a horrible hormonic stage my son had the same feelings at that agerange i did too even if life feels overwhelming and lonely now this will pass eventually be patient i have to go for a while but will get back to you with how my son learned to cope hang in there a big motherly hug to you;strong
sorry this is over a month old but i do hope you are feeling better the thing about bottom is there is only one other place to go talking things out with someone often puts things into perspective but even the act of just getting things off your chest usually helps let me know if you want to chat i will listen;weak
im sorry i wish i could help i feel the same way;strong
similar for me i fell like depression makes you care less about yourself i remember once walking the streets and jaywalking at every corner i was like so what if i get hit by a car worst case scenario i die its not as if that matters i wasnt actively trying to get myself killed just ignored my surroundings and my own safety fortunately i snapped out of it at some point or i might not be here anymore;weak
dont this is just an advice my way of looking at things i believe that you are not surrounding yourself with the right people but its true that most of the times we dont really get to choose who we meet having a caring heart is nothing to be ashamed of and it would be a pity if your kindness gets lost in the midst of the crowd just because you want to fit in there are a lot of people like you that i can assure you so as long as you are at peace with your thoughts and with who you are id suggest you should keep on being yourself take care ;no
hug i cant remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either i need a hug or a cuddle so bad the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me i feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time i dont know how long i can go on best of luck;strong
why do you hate yourself op we all make mistakes in life but we learn from it grow and hope to make better decisions moving forward thats part of life is there something thats causing you to feel guilt or shame hope everything turns out okay;weak
im sorry you have to deal with that toxic kind of person if i may ask i imagine you still live with her and have to deal with this kind of garbage pretty often;strong
ill be honest i feel kinda sorry for you you have completely nobody perhaps you had some people but due to some things those relationships didnt work out;strong
sorry to hear youre feeling this way can you see a doctor or a psychiatrist they can help you get anti depressant medication they will also probably tell you to make an appointment with a therapist and to see a therapist regularly hope this helps;strong
try not doing it to expect something in return it feels really forced i know you probably dont actually care but pretend like you really do with the mentality that youre doing this to make them feel better its gonna take some acting but it has to be genuine;no
u kidding man being an adult is way better im not bullied my teacher who abuse their power and i can spend my money however i want go wherever i want being a kid was really suffocating for me by comparison idk;no
thats hard especially if youre the type of person to post in this sub loving yourself is really difficult but loving others is easier and i do love you when you love others i find its easier to love yourself even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good i hope i helped;strong
im so sorry you feel that way would you like to elaborate im here if you need to chat;strong
shoot yourself in the face with kindness go and treat you some motherfucking chocolate and some fucking videogames and calm the holy fucking fuck down this was a lot of fucking swearing but even fucking think about killing your damn self you will leave some fucking people who will for fucking fuck sake miss you so  as as friendly reminder  please kill you you matter  never ever think about this again or even post this shit i want you to stay alive and fucking nail it you can do it buddy;weak

im sorry you feel like this my daughter has tried to kill herself 3 times and i pretty much have been mentally preparing myself for the worst for the last 6 months bc she was so so depressed and non responsive to meds therapy etc then the craziest thing happenedshe got involved in an old hobby met new people she had stuff in common with and just 5 minutes ago told me that she is going out to lunch with someone from that group my point isthings can change i hope things can change for you soon;strong
im so sorry i understand your loss my grandma just passed away on 0526 its hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories i know it seems cliche but it really does get better with time;strong
please dont its just not right choice make there is always something that can be done other than that;strong
its just one of those normal things in life well keep on trying and well keep on failing the reason success feels good is because you work for it dont let disappointment get to you look at it this way being disappointment means you know you couldve done better your time amp effort isnt wasted as long as you learn from what you did just keep on am i making sense sorry for rambling;weak
hang in there bro shit happens im going through some similar times right now but its okay try to find something to take your mind off them it will help a bunch im always down to chat if you want send me a dm;weak
hi friend  im really sorry youre in such pain  sometimes the people we have around us cant see the pain were in because they dont want to they may see it not know how to help us and are afraid to because it may cause them pain this may seem like useless advice but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how youre feeling and ask them to try and help you nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling but by talking to them and letting them know you can help them to understand you sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves i had to tell my best friend i was feeling suicidal but by telling her she helped me turn my life around she just didnt realise its never easy to do but i can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what youre going through lastly i hope you dont die not until youve been able to live the life that you want the life that you deserve to have im sending you love and luck;strong

sorry for your loss but dont feel guilty theres probably a reason why you feel that way also your feelings might clear with time;strong
im sorry this is true for me as well and they regularly remind me i think we can get through it though actually thats a lie i hope you can get through it im not going to be able too;strong

i know i sadly do not have a good answer as clueless as you are;weak
i would consult the doctor before doing anything because a certain amount of one medication can affect others;no
why the heck do we hate ourselves man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else sorry to get weird there it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves anyway i have one scar on my arm from one time that i tried that and there forever it still makes me sad when i see it so sorry for what pain you are in there will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself amp the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face;strong
im in the same boat actually just took way too many pills and hope i dont wake up if i do then i guess its not my time keep your head up its not worth it;weak

a cool way of looking at it i have never felt that way but i hope i can one day cheers;no
i get it at some point a few years ago i stopped being able to feel joy even when im feeling stable i still dont feel happy when ive described this to my therapist and psychiatrist they challenge me on it  you talk about good things dont you feel happy when those happen  but i know the difference it is very much like an old lost friend i actually might use that metaphor in therapy this week;weak
i bought my self kfc no one is doing anything or i should say i was invited to nothing im sorry to hear that im sure she loves you or why else would you still be living with her if you just went over to visit im unsure why youd put your self threw that;strong

quote ive always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end if its not okay its not the end i understand that is a very hard thing to believe i went out of it over two and a half years and i hadnt ever known about these kinds of things until i was 19 just trying to say it can be done man love you;strong
you need to remember that word is bond one thing that im trying really hard to do is to be a best friend to myself would i tell my best friend shes incapable of making her own life better no i would tell her yeah youve been having a really hard time and thats understandable but youre strong and youre loved and youre amazing and you have a big heart and mind you can do this and im going to be here for you the whole time;weak
im sorry youre feeling unwell i cant sleep either ive been having a couple nights of unrest i hope youre having better luck than i am also stay strong i know its hard and its a long journey but the fact that you want to stop is a start sleep well;strong
thats pretty awesome dude smiling is fun;strong
came here to say just this;no
life is like a wave there are ups and downs one day no matter how hard been your life will get better again but until then see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality there is no such thing as or you define if it is try to find the postive part in your current situation there is always a reason why some things happen the reason is to teach you a lesson for example if you have no friends like me see it as negative try to find the lesson behind this experience in this case life wants to tell you that loneliness is not what you in your deepest self want you need persons such as friends around you take a desicion now that you want to be lonely anymore and life will listen to you and bring you friends again and if it work try to know why it i know the answer but a bit complicated msg me if you want to know and what the lesson in this experience is also life is like a mirror if you feel lonely inside the outside world will deliver you that loneliness pretty simple so if you want to be lonely anymore try not to feel lonely i know fking hard but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth msg me if you want to know more if you feel lonely inside that means that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you notloneliness which means new persons will enter your life  oh also life is a paradox right with love being complicated but at the same time the easiest thing you could possibly imagine if you understand something just reply ;no
i believe your can dislike an individuals attitude or personality or health but the being itself has no cause for dislike aside from physical appearance;no
i would love to hug you irl _ hugs;weak
i am sorry im alive;strong
for what worth it probably mean much coming from a complete stranger but glad it failed or the world would have just lost 1 more good person and we are low on them as is you can pm me anytime if you wanna talk;strong
that is a very true definition of sadness just out of curiosity why wouldnt you want to take a risk of trying different medications that might help you you dont know how they affect you until you try them you state that things are unbearable now so it seems worthwhile to try something that might help you to be happier  even if it causes a side effect of growing a 2nd big toe on your right foot   the internet is hard to scientifically research complicated subjects most of the better data amp studies are not accessible or behind paywalls  i hope that you are feeling a little better we get new opportunities every day but it is hard to get over mistakes in the past sometimes unfortunately we cant change the past until i finish the time machine that im working on in my basement  feel free to contribute to my kickstarter fundraiser ;weak
well i can say that i think its really good that it gets better throughout the day for me its the opposite my mornings are bleh as the day goes on into the night i feel better and before bed time i feel depressed i think everyone is just different and maybe getting your day started gets rid of some mental worries and anticipation;weak
thats awesome huge props to you i havent gotten that far yet because mine was so wellwritten lol and im not convinced i wont need it again but thatll be a next step for me too;weak
is it an excuse if its true depression i mean;no

my ex used to feel like this as did i we both had problems and the best we could do was talk and be completely honest on where we stood with things like this i hope he doesnt leave just because he maybe feels overwhelmed but ive been on both ends and felt a burden as well so you arent alone on that i really do hope things work out if you ever need a pm buddy i have a pretty free schedule and am always looking for more pen pals and possibly more friends;weak
i think its social anxiety  that creates paranoid feelings  unless im wrong but thats how i feel;no
i hate tv in general all those fake ass shows with acting makes me throw up in my mouth my parents think that its entertaining because its real no its entertaining because theyre paid to be entertaining;no
omgosh i just want to validate this feeling because i have been there that said if its a matter of safety there is no question you know that you need to go you just do it its not some kind of failure you are taking care of yourself it does super suck though dont let anyone tell you its all fine and fun to go through that ive been there ive come out the other end and been okay for long periods too though so i mean it doesnt stay like that hang on it gets better;weak
for past trauma i found emdr pretty effective its a technique used in therapy its basically designed for ptsd which sounds like youre dealing with thats all i can think of regardless i hope you can get some solace;weak
the thing about depression is that its not at all about feeling sadits about feeling nothing nothing matters nothing makes you feel anything people turn to things like drugs and selfharm in order to feel something even if its deadly;no

i was on a very low dose of celexa only 10mg but that was causing enormous weight gain im really short and i was gaining a pound a month i tapered off quickly on the expectation that the mental pain of getting fat this quickly was going to counteract any benefit from the drug i went off and im on gabapentin now and melatonin and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay i used to tell myself meds were a weakness but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job which was in the cards if i hadnt gone to see a therapist i know it feels shameful but really its no different than needing glasses or a coat when its cold if your current meds help you stay on them and dont feel bad about it;weak
and when you cannot even trust yourself that is when you are the lowest;no
nothing to be afraid of would your bf be embarassed to go to hospital after breaking his finger no why should you be scared to seek mental help broken finger hurts depression if not treated can kill and in the worst way possible go and find yourself a therapist someone you can tell all about your problems hope it works out;no
im sorry that haopened ive never had a breakup because i always get rejected ive had similar things so i can at least get an idea of how that must feel but i believe you can find another girl you live;strong
i try to cope by trying to keep my own goals from the past that were broken alongside those i may make in the current time intact for myself whether or not that can happen or if its meant to be for me i dont and honestly cant know unless and until i get there from still trying i am living but not alive  there is a difference im trying to find completion for that void i try to accept myself and my flaws  even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that i still fight myself over that andor other things at times but i still try to accept and understand i just keep going for the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me as i want it if its there i must get to it  i must have it at the same time i must better myself until i am who and what ive always wanted to be both in and out the sense of failure and futility are always there  i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me i try to do things for myself i thought i had from others things i would truly want done to me by others but theres nobody i got used to it despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way i just think of what who might actually still exist out there think and feel if i werent doing this willingly to keep pushing i keep trying to believe that regardless i deserve things my way after everything especially that it cant all be for naught ive yet to see that thats why im still going for the future even if its path got shattered longago manyatime i hope this helps;no
being alone is terrible im sorry youre alone if i hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there then i suggest doing just about anything different anything really break your horrible lonely routine the only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change what can you do differently tomorrow;strong
had very violent and psychotic thoughts my whole life been very violently raised and i know how to turn it off but what learned that makes me feel better is just thoughts they go away for us depressed the thoughts have tighter grips on our conscious and therefore stick around longer i say get busy doing something you like or go outside right now and sprint down the block i promise if you do that feel better i promise;no
shoot yourself in the face with kindness go and treat you some motherfucking chocolate and some fucking videogames and calm the holy fucking fuck down this was a lot of fucking swearing but even fucking think about killing your damn self you will leave some fucking people who will for fucking fuck sake miss you so  as as friendly reminder  please kill you you matter  never ever think about this again or even post this shit i want you to stay alive and fucking nail it you can do it buddy;weak

honestly tell him to fuck off you dont deserve that bullshit op;weak
because depression isnt the same for everyone so there is no one size fits all cure for everyone and some of the things you mentioned can be downright harmful for some people for instance tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge theres a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis this sub is more of a support group meant for encouraging each other to hang on to keep fighting and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help im sincerely glad you beat depression what worked for you though may not work for everyone else or even anyone else its a very personal and individual experience and thats where you should have gone with this submission you shouldve just shared your story talked about your depression talked about your journey through it and how you beat it instead you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil this is dangerous territory because when you say things like i beat depression and you can too heres how you are selling people hope if it doesnt work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse even in one single instance you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope again thats why we leave treatment to the professionals please i cant stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar they are there for a reason;no

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong

well done youve shattered the illusion  but where are you trying to make it where are you going sometimes we all have to fake the way we are in order to get where we need to be or get to what we want but other times all that effort is so dragged on and futile because we are working to satisfy some expectation then at the end of the day satisfying the expectation is underwhelmingdissatisfying to its core then we just think ok now what just this post is poetic enough to make me think that youve got some fancy talents locked up in that head of yours i wish you luck my friend i bet you can make something of yourself even if you struggle to believe it and chances are youve probably already done some neat things and i hope youve taken the time to appreciate these accomplishments im wishing you fantastic luck;weak
i feel you have you thought about speaking to a therapist or call a depression hotline im not sure where you are living but those calls are usually free and the people on the other end are pretty great at listening and coming up with helpful strategies hang in there;weak

i saw your post several hours ago and ive been thinking all afternoon about what you asked im not sure if i can fully explain the shift i made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person i am now there was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations ive made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post or series of them i joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking trying to understand this community and seeing if i have anything to contribute and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey to answer your specific question the one thing i have come to understand is that there really isnt going to be a time when you are entirely done with it there will always be a chance however small that you can fall back into it however the longer you go without falling back in the easier it gets i tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies im going to have to create a post on that the truths ive found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones its about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression and being able to pull yourself back out its about accepting and finding value in yourself and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive to contribute and interact with the rest of the world coming from the other side i understand so many things that i used to see as negative really dont have any sort of positive or negative connotation that was all in my head often those negative connotations were put there by others sometimes inadvertently sometimes deliberately i had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign i learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using and which ones were not and discard them i know this doesnt really explain much how i see things now and how i no longer feel depressed all the time but i promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how i got where i am and maybe help you make a similar journey;no

its not about what you do at work though its what you do with your time outside of work most peoples dreams dont come true no that doesnt mean you should just waste away in a pitiful existence find excitement in things work hard achieve things see progress ive been in your place completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be the truth is you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be dreams of things exist because people see the start of something and then only the end of it being famous having lost all that weight etc thats not reality and more people have worked hard for what they have;no

they probably already know that cutting yourself good people who self harm probably hear that often including myself as much as you know logically that cutting good sometimes you help it if it means that tiny bit of relief try suggesting alternative methods instead and asking why they cut is it the pain or is it seeing blood if pain tightly holding cold ice can be an alternative there is pain but no damage if blood instead of cutting trying using a red marker to mark themself instead talk through everything step by step and find possible solutions or alternatives at each step;no
i just try to remind myself its a thing of the past and thats all it will be the pain ive felt and been through is no longer painful sure it hurts to think about but not as much as it hurt in the process people that live in the past live with guilt people that live in the future live with anxiety people that live in the present live with peace;no
been there but can i give a really cool trick that might truly help when looking for a job try to find a new storerestaurantplace opening up no matter what it is it was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc anyway what worked for me in the end either way keep trying taking it one step at a time fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews if you get too anxious and go then go but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go and if you start working and like it ok you can look elsewhere so just keep pushing along;weak
not sure i whine about life all the time but if i had the solution use it right away be gone tonight;no

ive never done it but ive seen people do it usually with 5 or 6 dogs they have apps and websites for walking or pet sitting it might take a month to build some clients but the hours are flexible and you pretty much get to be your own boss and pet dogs all day the main thing is to choose something you enjoy it will feel much less soul killing and will come naturally rather than feeling like youre fighting to survive;weak

im down in that hole dont get sucked in is my advice youll get nothing good out of it the thing with alcohol is that once you start drinking too much too often the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all its i drink to forget but ive drank so much i dont know what it is i have to forget so i drink just to be sure alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and i cant really live without them anymore i need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness  but trust me id be way less miserable if i never started it;no

hi friend someone will always it worse this is true but i think that you should draw strength from the fact not that others have it worse but that you know there is better i certainly understand the feeling of the teeter totter between living in hell and trying too hard dont let the fear of being not down to earth shackle you my friend reach out and grab for what makes you feel alive because there is far more uncertainty in sitting back and watching i truly feel that your reactions to others lives highlights your ability to empathize and live harvest that energy for its beauty and not its sadness stay strong;weak

im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong

yup in my experience sertraline was more intense than escitalopram the first few days and i started slow at like 125mg its really the first week  actually about the first 4 days  effect the thing that requires the black box warning because its a surprise if no one tells you to expect it and not everyone gets it so powerfully if its too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower ive settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesnt all hit you at once  sertralines got a relatively short serum life and im preferring a morning and afternoon dose  and during this jittery period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so youll have a shot at getting some proper sleep it gets a lot more boring but still potentially helpful once your body adapts right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and its pretty much the psychedelic part once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a buffer of serotonin in the synapses so its there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying ssri side effects in the longer term so if you feel like youre going to jump out of your skin now  yeah thats normal and it passes in about those 47 days for me anyway also headsup that yeah with sertraline those days included a lot of nausea and ahem intense gi effects for me too  that passes too;no

i thought so until i came to realized that your health department is seriously lacking getting a pension would be really nice if you have that in your country but its usually quite low but beside that the health is too damn hard of course you got 70 years old being president or running marathon and all but ive seen people around me and its just a blend of being tired in pain and or being slow clumsy close to handicap doing basic things it scares me especially with all the diseases that my relatives have or had and the fact that i dont take care of my body as well as i couldshould sorry if this is triggering anything in anyone or a bit despairing one upside is that science is doing wonders so in your life time you could survive more shit being treated better and i believe our generation is going to react to the way we take care of the elderly in general do not lose hope but the grass is always greener;weak

sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong
maybe it would exhaust them more over time but the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt they may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves they will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life talk with your family work through it together accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you it will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier;weak

sorry to hear  is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases how does being high help;strong
have you tried joining in and failed i know how that feels man im sorry;weak
i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong
yeah why do i even exist lol im useless;no
sending some good vibes and prayers your way i hope you find the help you seek with your treatments and if this isnt what helps please dont ever stop looking exercise became my escape but it wasnt through cardio or weight training like i had done for years with zero progress towards self improvement it came in the form of dancing best of luck and please feel free to dm me when you need to vent about anything;weak

as a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there it is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college i know what youre feeling well actually mine was worse since i had little friends but if i could back and give myself advice id tell myself to man up and do well work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now please believe in yourself and press forward although you have all the time in the world to make changes waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression its a problem you dont want to deal with when your older its best done in the present;weak

i probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing do you write i find it helpful to seal away any selfdetrimental desires inside characters who are not me if you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page you might find some relief literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself my life is not pleasant by any means so i created the life that i want in my writing my life became better through writing what ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon what adventures could you go on in your own book think of all the memories that could be shared you could even write about a rolemodel mine is typhon the greek dragon under the mountain i obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm he shows up in all of my work my advice would be to pound that pain out into a character a mighty simulacrum an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear im not sure if im phrasing this well enough to help but this is the only way i know how to express myself;no
whats up buddy  want to talk ;weak
you are seen we care about you here its not always a booming because everyone is so sad themselves but we look out for eachother here;weak
yeah with you longing for the next sincere laugh or anything that i find funny anymore or someone who will play that game with me in real life;no
because you are important your life matters you shall find someone who will be understanding and there for you when you are depressed you just need to let yourself be vulnerable and keep dating until you find the right person it may take awhile but its worth the wait for you and that future person;weak

i know you mean well but this really help a large majority of people with depression plenty of people afford professional help or it work for them some people myself included make any friends at all the negativity among other things that comes with this illness is like a poisonous cloud that brings other people down with you and ultimately pushes them away;weak
i remember when i was in a deep stage of depression i always begged my mother to let me stay home even when she drove me to school i would catch a bus to the shops and ditch school never got caught hehe anyway i just felt so bored of school and so sick of all the shit that went down there instead i decided to live my life have fun sleep ditch school or do whatever and just live the life as i wanted to if you cant find motivation in one thing than find motivation in another after all were all gonna die one day live your life as you want;weak
ya a few weeks ago my manager at work made a rude comment to me she does this all the time and it wasnt even that big of a deal but i was depressed for like 3 days i went home that night and legitimately wanted to die sometimes its just the straw that broke the camels back yknow;weak

in my experience when meds start working you slowly start having good days now and then you may get like two good days three bad days some good days again etc until you keep getting more and longer stretches of good days for me its actually a sign that the meds are working dont worry about work too much your health is more important and is your priority right now;weak

people dont really care about anything other than themselves not applicable to everyone of course but using people as a means to an end is common and people dont care how you feel as long as they get what they want idk about you but sometimes this is the case even with family if even your family doesnt give a shit then who will;no
im sorry for however long you still have to deal with them but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to and that is 100 okay you are your own very awesome person and they dont get a say in who you are;strong

i wish i even had the will to play games for me its excessive daydreaming;no
that is great keep feeling good;weak
i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong
i remember one time my wife had driven home to visit family the first thing i did when i got home was hit the bottle i was so excited to race home and get drunk to drown my pain about 34s of that bottle later i was in such pain that i couldnt help but to tell my wife she knew i had problems but not to what extent i went to bed that night praying to god for death wishing so bad to die in my sleep i wanted it so bad i look back on that time in my life as the breaking point the point in which i decided i was meant for more than this i was balling my eyes out i couldnt help but cry my emotional pain manifested into that of physical pain it hurt so bad but i have made it through that i have achieved so much and i know that you can too if you need anything please pm me ill give you my cell if you want to talk you are stronger than this worthless disease;weak
im so sorry to hear about your situationthats a really difficult thing to have to endure especially with your familys lack of understanding i dont think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your paineven if there is not a reliable treatment now pain relief is a major area of medical science research is medical marijuana legal where you live or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is you might find support and recommendations at rsciatica hang in there i would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if thats an option otherwise it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity paid or unpaid that is meaningful to you if movement is an issue look up online opportunities which will help you get your mind off of your pain;strong
im sorry your situation at home is so difficult do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how youre feeling;strong
im so sorry i understand your loss my grandma just passed away on 0526 its hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories i know it seems cliche but it really does get better with time;strong
im locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now about 2 years ago i developed a movement disorder it has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors havent figured out anything about it the depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life crippling my quality of life and reducing what i can do this feeds into my depression more negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures i often fall down and have issues walking and standing can barely leave my home am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes no medication helps my mental or physical health it actually worsens both i am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded it has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me seen several specialist this terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months;no
i look in the mirror and only see sad dead eyes looking back;no
its true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon weve gone very far into the illusions of separation and its going to take some time to break through these but its going to happen i have no doubt anymore im sending you love and hugs through the wire even if its only designed for 0 and 1 feel it;strong
im so sorry youre going through this my dog passed away two months ago so i know how painful it is  i adopted another dog i was still upset but it definitely helped me with the grieving process;strong
you are not alone just remember that;weak
the thing though your death be feasible your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you one of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own i used to think that no one would miss me much if i killed myself but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm that something that you can just get over even leaving notes really help the pain for your family also consider the suffering of the people who found you it could be an ra or a dorm mate they would be traumatized for life with severe ptsd from seeing a dead decomposing body that point would be too late for you to do anything so we try not to let it go that far get me wrong i know where coming from and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong and clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations so build on that take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well forgive me for being brash but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide the people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it please for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you think again there is hope out there even if everything seems hopeless right now;weak
im so sorry you feel that way would you like to elaborate im here if you need to chat;strong
i remember this one keep fighting;weak
sorry man pc masterrace here hope youll spruce up your friend list nicely;strong
it means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that it is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know being miserable the term fetishizing is used in a harsh accusatory pejorative way blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so furthermore fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature because such random nonsexual items produce intense satisfaction whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves if i fuck myself up no one else will;no
great way of putting it life is just so exhausting i cant leave the house without caffeine i have no interests i just feel like an empty battery hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance;weak

hey i understand what you are feeling and i am so sorry you are experiencing this  really such a hopeless feeling please feel free to pm me if you would like to talk about anything;strong

what convinced you you in my case i had been working hard on my career but my supervisors needed to cut me off they had a year on me but i was on their level of skill i realized that the most important thing in the world to be taken away from me or controlled by others and that i do anything about it classic case of with power do what they can those without suffer what they felt pretty pointless since;no

i get this to i used to feel great then when i became depressed it started to trigger my anxieties its hard to know whether it enlightens you to things you didnt want to know or whether the its just making you paranoid but regardless it makes me feel down it affects all people differently only thing i could suggest is having a beer or something with it to try and reduce your anxiety;no
look i dont know you hell i probably never will and im not gonna pretend to know what wrong in your life but im sure that theres someone out there who cares about you ive never been at the point where you are now but ive had some hard times there is a high probability that things will get better i dont know you but i love you and i know that i cant be the only person who doesnt want you to do this;weak

yeah were creatures of habit unfortunately i also find myself falling into the same pits over and over again but yknow what sometimes life just clicks together and all the pieces fit into the big picture and you find that moment where you can change it doesnt have to be overnight but look for some baby steps that can put your forward best of luck x;weak

why did you refuse meds it definitely doesnt sound like youre very stable right now and i can relate to feeling like you cant think straight and need to find something drastic to snap out of it meds help contain my worst moods though even if they dont rid me completely;weak
feel free to message me if youd like one of the reasons i joined was to find friends to help battle my anxiety and depression;weak
all the time man still remember when i used to go outside play with friends not worry about anything and just live life till that one day when everything just fell apart i lost my friends my motivation to go outside and be social my parents trust its all gone and i cant go back;no

im very proud of you too remember the great feeling of success you have right now it will help you next time you have the urge;strong
why do you feel its not going to get better for you;no
sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong
i wish it was that simple i went through the same thought process think of it this way an easy suicide is going to take some set up living is way easier plus once the depression clears youll be glad you did;weak

nah man what youre saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at recognizing good art but get frustrated because their own art doesnt live up to the crazy high standard theyve set for themselves malcom gladwell suggests that it takes 10000 hours to gain mastery in something art is a skill just like anything else i think a lot of people get fooled into this you either have it or you dont mentality when it comes to creative arts its just not the case i think its more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at most people dont have that just keep practicing and never give up if you have the drive you will succeed eventually youll get better and better every day;weak
only you can answer the question i personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life though i agree that the hamster wheel and ratrace pretty sucks but i just dont see much alternative at this point if i want to keep doing what i do now;weak
i guess it makes a person more defensive against other people but it really depends on the person some people enjoy being alone and some people cant stand it;no

getting a job is pretty stressful when youre feeling down it doesnt help that sometimes finding a job or the right job at least is pretty stressful itself what i found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well if thats something interesting to you call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities as an added bonus volunteering work looks good on some job applications;no

it is a sector in boom right now there are tons of jobs and its only growing you will have no problem finding a job whatsoever however i understand your worry is money even after you get a job keep looking and applying the more experience you have the better you can probably find jobs that pay higher and higher idk how far youre in right now through your course but if its not too late try taking some security courses as well while it is in a boom having security courses on your resume would almost guarantee that you will always have a job literally every company needs help with security and theyre will to pay lots of money to find it everything will be fine;weak
well i can say that i think its really good that it gets better throughout the day for me its the opposite my mornings are bleh as the day goes on into the night i feel better and before bed time i feel depressed i think everyone is just different and maybe getting your day started gets rid of some mental worries and anticipation;weak

there are many services that local and state governments provide to help people such as yourself find work the cool thing is they are totally free and they can provide a support system and will work with you to find a job that works for you i would suggest looking online for these services and sending your information to them stay strong and i love you;strong
hey is there something thats overwhelming you or something that you are avoiding what is going on why are you in bed sometimes when you share it can help to lighten the burden;no
that solves nothing and will hurt your loved ones to no end the road to recovery takes a long time and is so much hard work but when you get there everything will change seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step the second step is finding something anything to get out of bed for for me it was my cat i would go without eating for days because i didnt want to leave my house and i didnt want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself when my cat ran out of food i would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldnt be hungry when he curled up with me i felt good at a time that nothing else felt good he passed a few months ago but he flat out saved my life and im constantly grateful life can be overwhelming especially when you feel the way you do but you can make it better dont be afraid to ask for help;weak

very sorry to hear it she came back the first time;strong
sorry to hear i hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again;strong
the more it manifests itself the more itll take over your mind and convince you that its a completely logical choice im a fan of therapy considering that you can find a good therapist talking to someone who doesnt degrade you for how you feel can be incredibly helpful those people tend to be hard to find in daily life;weak
dont worry we are mortal for a reason;weak
absolutely self doubt drifting thoughts bleak view of the future and a tsunami of regret floods my mind regularly every evening then i retreat to the internet which keeps me up all night its a little out there but ive had incredible relief from my insomnia depression and chronic pain using an aerial yoga hammock i hang it from the ceiling right next to my bedcomputer desk and usually just cacoon in it for an hour or so feeling weightless and swaying back and forth has an incredibly natural calming effect on the mind they are only 60 on amazon too feel better my friend you are not alone;weak

im sorry man i wish i could take the pain away;strong
omg lol i 100 blame my parents after taking an ap psychology course at my school it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression i know i cant claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents the genetic aspects arent their fault of course but they are perfect human specimens so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process strangely being cognizant of that fact doesnt change it much of course ive directly told my parents i blame them for who i am and as perfect specimens they told me that i cant keep blaming them for everything theres truth to that of course but its rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility id better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim since theyre the ones who work and pay for my existence regardless of whether or not i can actually do jack shit about that child labor laws yo lol sorry your post is just so relatable i had to rant;strong
alright breathe its going to be okay your adrenaline is pumping and youre not thinking clearly take a moment step outside get a snack or some thing to drink its going to be okay unfortunately you didnt give any description so im not sure what i can help you with but mani can tell you one thing things sure do have a funny way of fixing itself or getting better even when you least expect it to keep your chin up;weak
it is unfair modern psychologypsychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness it often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others dont suffer from grief should we commit suicide as we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness policies and social norms will change some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness but whats strange about all of this is even though im certain i have the right to kill myself because im miserable everyday i am pulling for you to live even though youre a stranger on the internet i have hope for you and i dont even know you i want you to wait it out to battle it out not because you owe me or anyone else but because i think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now what have you tried so far to get some relief has anything worked what can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment;weak
chemically using calcium hydroxide easy to go overboard though i have on several instances burned so deeply it destroyed nerve cut too but generally stick with burns;no
hate to say it but it sounds like you might have a bad dr one time during a depressive episode i happened to tell my dr everything that was going on with me similar to your situation he started me on a new medication but did not mess around with a lower dose just a thought that maybe she shouldnt have started you on the lowest dose assuming she knew you had attempted that is;weak

i do understand why upset you pour your heart and soul out and do everything you can in order to make that special person happy but keep in mind that they ask you to go above and beyond that was a choice you made not fair to expect them to reciprocate when the one who wanted to pamper them i think that instead of trying to you should voice your thoughts to her you can explain how you feel that you hope they can try to be more  affectionate attentive appreciative etc this is a relationship communication is so important but more importantly is respect for each other if u care about her try and make her sad because hurt and sometimes it takes time for a relationship to build trust and affection some people as good at dating as others i hope doing okay whether you stay with her or not;no

its a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy and one by one those things get taken from you what i try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right ie something that costs money makes you happy but you dont make enough money need a way to make more money dedicate all free time to applying for better work or feel lonely and havent got anybody need to find somebody to stop feeling like that need to know best places to find somebody research ways to meet people and put self into that situation or feel worthless being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you and you can feel needed honestly i know its not that easy a fix and there will be more bumps to overcome one of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness and even having looked at places to go i still havent found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people but generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable even just through reading online about how to get started can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it wont be like that forever and that there is a physical tangible mortal way to deal with the situation so i would recommend pick a small goal that can lead to some form of happiness and work towards that rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap helps you take it day by day a little easier and i hope that would make each new day if not better at least consistent for you feel better soon bud;weak

maybe you can find a room mate or something  idk what type of housing you live in eg apt house renting etc but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if thats something youre looking for maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes people can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals in some cases they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed sometimes its easy to focus on the negative of living alone but there are tons of good things about it as well you just gotta look towards those as well;weak

mirtazapine as far as i know is used for depressioninsomnia typically not for adhd i would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion it would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg 2weeks then bumped up to 30mg but i see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game side effects of mirtazapine are that it will make you tired so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd again look into vyvance you may gain some weight also that is a common side effect also some anxiety could occur but that is rare important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones or ask your doctor before you even get prescribed them;no

all i can provide for you is the cliche reply telling you that there is much more to life than struggling and that it can change if you try to but non of this might affect you you yourself have control of your own life and what you do with it all i can say is that you might be making a really regrettable decision as you only have one life to live and enjoy to a degree you only get one chance to feel anything if nothing and that is more than an incentive for most to keep going;no

omg lol i 100 blame my parents after taking an ap psychology course at my school it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression i know i cant claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents the genetic aspects arent their fault of course but they are perfect human specimens so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process strangely being cognizant of that fact doesnt change it much of course ive directly told my parents i blame them for who i am and as perfect specimens they told me that i cant keep blaming them for everything theres truth to that of course but its rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility id better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim since theyre the ones who work and pay for my existence regardless of whether or not i can actually do jack shit about that child labor laws yo lol sorry your post is just so relatable i had to rant;strong
happy birthday i hope you do something fun after work;weak
i agree this is a good reminder thank you i remember realizing that the way i treated myself was much harsher than i would treat anyone else the best advice that helped me was to talk to myself as i would talk to a loved friend i imagine that self compassion applies we would show compassion to a dear friend so we should practice that compassion with ourselves;weak

ive struggled with abandonment issues most of my life my fiancee left me last year my friends and family act like i dont exist and even though i brought that up in the one counselling session ive ever had i still got turned down for counselling i tried going private and still got the same result what does it say when someone with abandonment issues gets turned away by a therapist you cant tell someone that their therapist cares about them because you care about the kids you look after;no

i think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing getting out of the house is recommended even if its something like going to work obviously do whatever you feel is best but i dont think skipping work is going to help you get any better for example i could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though im here hating it i would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day;no

as someone said here previously depression doesnt care who you are where you are from what you have or dont have even if you dont have serious problems depression makes you feel like youre carrying all the problems of the world its true btw there are people who are disabled blind deaf and still be happy i dont have any of these problems yet feel shit most of the time and that makes me feel guilty;no
dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums i suggest you to focus on your own happiness first then be there to support them when they need you you are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals live and let live support and be supported are the key you are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldnt give more than what you must it should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return balance is key communication is the order respect and understanding is the borderline;weak

what are you needing help with part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed there is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds and monitoring lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient refer a psych and hope for the best they are not terrible can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term i found this works better for me than long term antidepressents;no
talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
theres nothing wrong with being a virgin im one too and i dont feel bad about myself for it im proud of it actually also i dont understand sexuality probably because of my autism remember its not a competition once you lose it you cant get it back there are a lot of other types of love out there than just physical love i dont understand why people around my age are upset about being a virgin to begin with dont feel so negative about yourself there are people in this world who love you already such as your family take care of yourself;no

my boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday the pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak when we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners and as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon i am not sure why you two broke up and i know it hurts extremely bad and life has lost much of its meaning i will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly this will be tough this will hurt and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for but i must tell you this feeling is temporary it will not last forever how long it will last i cannot say when it will end i cannot say either but take it one day at a time do things that are only necessary for your existence and those that are extra if you are not up to it do it within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts beat yourself up about them when the time is right started to fix those things and if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so but you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life become strong from this;weak

omg lol i 100 blame my parents after taking an ap psychology course at my school it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression i know i cant claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents the genetic aspects arent their fault of course but they are perfect human specimens so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process strangely being cognizant of that fact doesnt change it much of course ive directly told my parents i blame them for who i am and as perfect specimens they told me that i cant keep blaming them for everything theres truth to that of course but its rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility id better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim since theyre the ones who work and pay for my existence regardless of whether or not i can actually do jack shit about that child labor laws yo lol sorry your post is just so relatable i had to rant;strong

dude this feeling i know it and sadly this is a common goto response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute its out of context and beside the point in essence its a variation of the ever popular at least you arent a starving kid in insert country here and more generally it could be worse like yes thanks very much captain obvious everything is relative but thats beside the point its invalidating insensitive and snobby at best and i have no idea if it helps you feel any better but when a lot of people say it they do think theyre doing some genuine good to help you feel better despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is my boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after years of explaining why this is not a good response hes slowly using it less but when it pops up my typical counter is that does not help memake me feel better at all and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said in any case im sorry you had that shitty nonreason response thrown at you what youre going through is real and valid even if others choose not to acknowledge it;strong

1 are the problems you have permanent or out of your control 2 have you talked with all of your friends and family or a therapist i dont know what you are going through but whatever it is is it really that bad you feel the need to end your life now just think about what all your friends and family will think once you are gone they will be blaming themselves forever because they will feel like they are at fault because they didnt help you when you needed it most again idk what going through but think of how many people are going through as worse or worse than you and still tough it out and make it through;weak

sorry to hear that but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school my best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed for me essential to plan my assignments in advance so that i can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then i wanna die also if you need a break take one school will always be there but good to take care of yourself too ;strong
not seasonal but it gets worse in the winter;no
the generic answers heard over the years tend to go something like the following exercise sunlight talking therapy stroking animals eating healthily meditation and writing one thing thankful for daily i say with sincerity that any of those have worked for me but helped others keeping busy with hobbies on the days able to function might help it does slightly for me;no
let others suffer with you the biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in it fools us into believing there is no one that will understand tells us not to burden others with our problems demands we keep our pain in the shadows but this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness we feel lonely hate that we feel lonely feel stupid for looking weak and decide to keep it hidden we find worth in our connection to others not because they decide if we are worthy or not but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others im not sure of your circumstances but i can tell you that i have been in your shoes i have felt completely cut off from the world i have laid in bed night after night wondering why i should even be here i have been so lost and hard on myself that i couldnt even look at my face in the mirror i have broken down in just about every room of the places i lived and expected it to never change but it did not all at once it took time but when i began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help and by also helping others myself it doesnt need to be family or current friends finding support is a hard thing these days but there are great places now to get help working through the pain of living;no

ive had a similar realization recently but my reaction is a bit different ive decided to try my past to fight against these thoughts and problems to find ways to be happy sometimes i have bad social anxiety and have started trying medication and meditation honestly it often feels harder than just giving into the depression forcing myself to go places that could make me feel uncomfortable because of too many people taking classes where i learn something completely new but maybe in the end ill be glad ive done these things;no

im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong

talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong

i find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily or also the pressure of feeling others expectations of you on your shoulders i still havent worked things out that im able to effectively handle failure myself but mainly people can feel better when they fail because they recognise it as a learning experience or it is an inevitable part of the process now this may sound obvious but when in the moment it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure failure can appear in many forms my expectation of a good outcome instead was a horrible mistake or was it im sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt just know that i believe you are alive and fighting and you will come out of this stronger;strong

yeah this feeling is a strong one felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood the truth is that i never dealt with it constructively or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling part of the reason i think you and i are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively in my case i used constant denial and selfnumbing  at some point i just assumed the pit was a part of me i could choose to ignore you seem to be actively trying to experience it you are engaging your sadness which is objectively good for working through depression it may not be what you might call conventional but everyone does their thing a little differently  if what you are doing no longer works for you though it might be best to start looking for other healthy ways of working through that discomfort personally when i feel that pit i know what thoughts tend to follow it fortunately my therapists and my stay at hospital helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard in order to redirect those thoughts that create it i try to reach out to anyone in my support net its hard because i feel like they wont give a shit but most of the time they do but i often choose to ignore that reality or i will simply write some positive words here on this reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others but for my own sake as well as you put so well giving that pit a purpose but dont cover that feeling up continue to engage with it as best as you can its there for a reason hopefully the more you work with it the easier it is to process and let go;weak
sorry for your loss but dont feel guilty theres probably a reason why you feel that way also your feelings might clear with time;strong
you cant stop the waves but you can learn to surf;no
im so sorry to hear about your situationthats a really difficult thing to have to endure especially with your familys lack of understanding i dont think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your paineven if there is not a reliable treatment now pain relief is a major area of medical science research is medical marijuana legal where you live or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is you might find support and recommendations at rsciatica hang in there i would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if thats an option otherwise it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity paid or unpaid that is meaningful to you if movement is an issue look up online opportunities which will help you get your mind off of your pain;strong

the fact that ill die xd;no
you know what kind of answer youll get here i know this is your state of mind right now but realize that it is a state of mind you want to take some kind of action to change your circumstances and right now suicide seems like the only option thats because taking some kind of action to change your circumstances helps lift your brain out of its depression suddenly you dont feel completely hopeless maybe life can be better after all except youd be having that thought as youre dying that would be terrible so you have to find some other way to turn things around;weak
try to let this show you that it isent your time things can be better it doesnt happen overnight although you wish it too please think of yourself and everyone who loves you too we only get one shot at this life please dont if you need to talk im here;weak

talk to him about it maybe he forgot it was your bday or he had an emergency for better or for worse talk to him about it and clear it up or else that terrible feeling you currently have is going to stick around for a sometime;no
take solace my friend there is no normal we are walking around with big bags of shit on our backs yours is different than mine but they are both full and they are both heavy make your way in the world lugging that bitch with you every where you go just like the rest of us;weak

the two biggest signs for me are when when i start neglecting my appearance and stop cleaning my room;no
im sorry for your pain wanna talk;strong
i used to do this a lot thinking of really aggressive and horrific things happening to me would make me feel so much better but afraid thinking like that would just make suicide seem easier and easier while here you might as well think or do something else you like anything at all even if really shitty or just doing drugs all day or whatever not here long anyway so you might as well do whatever makes you happy for the time being while we wait to expire;weak
right there with you today stay strong got this;weak
this year after a year no incident it felt so familiar and delicious in a way only those had the habit will know but its not a good habit its just not healthy to have open wounds constantly and cutting yourself to handle problems wont help you deal with whats upsetting you it instead will be a permanent reminder of the pain you feel now what if instead you used the energy to do something constructive express yourself do whatever you need to do you want to cut you dont need to you never have it was just a coping mechanism you lived without it before and theres no good reason to do it you dont need to do this youre not weak or damaged for losing to your emotions and giving into yourself now but dont lose yourself in the idea that you have to throw all the progress you made away its been three years and cut yourself once in all those three thats something to be proud of sorry this is kinda long but i personally cut for the first time at 11 and it become a habit til 13 i had a relapse myself earlier this year and i know the urge may never go away completely but its something you can control you can gain greater satisfaction doing something that fulfills you rather than damages you its just a fact;weak
its true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon weve gone very far into the illusions of separation and its going to take some time to break through these but its going to happen i have no doubt anymore im sending you love and hugs through the wire even if its only designed for 0 and 1 feel it;strong
i feel like there might just be an inbetween as well where someone might not care about you much but not mind being with you somemost of the time or is this a neutralpositive perspective;no
im so sorry i understand your loss my grandma just passed away on 0526 its hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories i know it seems cliche but it really does get better with time;strong
you really shouldnt be ashamed to cry in front of your mom i understand its embarrassing sometimes but hopefully she will understand how hard it is for you shes seen you cry before she knows youre human;weak
very sorry to hear it she came back the first time;strong
i hope it gets better for you just remember to take care of yourself while you are depressed what do you tell people to do when they are sick with the flu you tell them to drink water get plenty of rest dont overexert and eat bland foods drink tea medicine whatever this is recommended for the most rapid recovery if they neglect this advice they run the risk of getting sicker what do you tell someone who is sick with depression just do your best to keep up with life make sure you eat make sure you sleep brush your teeth do whatever chores you would normally do try not to turn to any vice or addiction and avoid isolating yourself if you upkeep with life you are more likely to see a faster recovery if you fail to upkeep you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed you are strong and you got this best of luck to you;weak
i ask myself the same thing do i really have a mental illness or is it all a sham to justify my weak pathetic demeanor why do you think your weak;no
keep positive man the best thing you can do is focus on yourself and your endeavors never quit never give up you got this man;weak
happy birthday im sorry your birthday is going less well than you hoped i had kind of a rough start in high school too so i know how you feel better than most im open to talk whenever you like;strong
im sorry that youre also in this position im honestly just waiting for my parents to die so i can kill myself;strong
yeah a really bad idea just ramping up the artificial amounts of dopamine consuming until numb to everything going to help in the slightest how you get addicted to heroin;no
it might be because its all weve ever known and were scared that anything else will be worse;no
yes wanna vent to each other just pm me;weak
do you have any hobbies do you like movies tv shows books music games they all seem to help me distract myself from feeling like shit distraction is your friend when you hit an especially low spot;no
if youre ever feeling really down and feel you have nobody to talk to always call a help line plus what even if calling does nothing its first occupied you for some time so that you dont do anything else and secondly its better then not even bothering to call at all please call a help line and trust me its what you need to do right now;weak
yeah bud same boat if im not working im in bed just zoning out not moving the struggle is real with no real answers;strong
hugs try and take care of yourself i know it seems hopeless and like your trapped but dont let this fucker get the best of you;strong
because sometimes it just takes time serotonin and dopamine take their time to adjust also though the gym is great it will deplete you so you might be suffering from that get a lot of protein magnesium and zinc and repeat tomorrow and congrats you did great today;strong
i can agree with every single thing you have listed there and experience them all it is not normal for a 24 year old good looking well educated man to be feeling this way  but i have never felt right in life the biggest thing that kills me is that i have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life i find myself completely and utterly alone every day my only communication is with my clients by email i do leave the house but its only to go to the grocery store or for a walk  by myself of course i read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that id love to visit but i can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all just sick of it;weak
im sorry for however long you still have to deal with them but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to and that is 100 okay you are your own very awesome person and they dont get a say in who you are;strong
thats quite a common symptoms among the depressed actually i can relate to very well;weak
me too i try to establish a connection they just stop talking eventually;no
being alone is terrible im sorry youre alone if i hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there then i suggest doing just about anything different anything really break your horrible lonely routine the only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change what can you do differently tomorrow;strong
im sorry ive been in and out of a relationship for years now shes loving and considerate and great in so many ways but theres no commitment actually the space between us has grown over the years i guess part of it is that im a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing i dont even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life but at the end of the day i just want to go home and share my life with her and shes not there shes done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line like im just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer im just too screwed up for it to work i feel so lonely and so stupid for everything ive done to turn her away;strong
you are capable of doing things on your own if your boyfriend doesnt make you happy you dont have to be with him if you are worried about coping you can take things slowly step by step i should follow my own advice here as well dont be afraid to seek therapy if you can it will help even if it only helps a little as for your job im sorry it didnt work out but dont let things ruminate in your mind worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you depression thrives in rumination try looking into mindfulness meditation its not spiritual garbage its literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts so that you dont get stuck in negative feedback loops it takes time to change your brain structure but it can be done another thing is to find distractions productive is better but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also delve into hobbies or learn a new skill be social and try new things thats the best way to cope in my opinion i need to take my own advice;weak
i know how you feel especially now that almost every day i get more and more bad news and more crap is piling on top of the old ones it gets harder seeing other people having fun together when i am alone it gets harder seeing my friend online but doesnt want to talk to me;weak
a precious entity so much more than the harm you cause yourself;weak
sorry you feel this way i do too it provides a release;strong
i know all too well what you mean people scare and anger me have for years and as a result i dont actually have a single person i would consider a friend and have never had a relationship but i crave that stuff every night it causes hard insomnia worrying about if ill have to be alone forever with no friends or partners to the point i can only sleep out of exhaustion but then once i have and i wake up the next morning ill loathe that i have to go outside and interact with people for work its a daily nightmare i would say that maybe if i gave advice on it it would be that i used to have a similar thing with shyness and with that i pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy it maybe might work the same way with likingdisliking social interaction but i do that everyday and i still dont like people im more comfortable around them but i still dont like them and its an entirely different ball park with depressionanxiety than shyness otherwise if it were so easy to just force yourself to socialize to fix the problem id be doing it myself if pushing yourself into those situations does help i hope you find the courage to do it sometime buddy;weak
i think it just could be that youre tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day and as youve said feel that you dont deserve the bed but trusy me that bed will be the greatest thing in your life whether its to sleep in or cry on you will feel bettee;weak
so many feels here to chat if youd like im going through a similar thing at the moment and its tearing me apart;weak
i cant tell you the quickest way to die but the easiest way to die which is to keep on living until you get too old;no
ahw im so sorry for you what happened to your dog if i may ask;strong
haha when i come back home i never even go out into my home town i cant tell you how severe that problem is  if i met an old friend id black outhad a dream it happenedits awful thats the social side  could you imagine the questions what are you up to what do you do etc fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that;no
are you afraid they will critizise you;no
so sorry for your loss;strong
talk with your teachers ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things most teachers would be happy to have you reach out plus by being in communication with them theyll be there to help keep your motivation up work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work i hate to say this but school academics come over sports if time mangement is becoming hard maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position freshmen year is easiest for most so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year im sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this but the first step is admitting you want help which youve done so good job ill be rooting for you;strong
thats good if only everybody around me wouldnt lie every chance they could;no
his friend is depression and his friend is telling him no;no
i cant make any promises p but im up so ill try to help whats up;weak
chill man high school isnt that bad all you have to do is just be chill and if you dont want to talk to anyone thats fine but eventually someone will want to talk to you thats just how it is ;strong
sorry to hear you have felt this way for so long some more background would be helpful were you ever bullied do you have a circle of friends;strong
could you call child protective services;no
quit your job make some coffee and jump in a raid dont get out of your pjs;no
i feel ya hope that youll get through this moment in time;weak
its the same for mei cant believe how little ive experienced theres a part of me that wants to really live rather than just existing but i dont know if ill ever be able to let myself i guess if you can take that step and put yourself out there make each day mean something even if its only small things etc you should but i know its a lot easier said than done i dont really have any advice for you but just wanted to let you know that youre not alone maybe volunteering somewhere could help you if thats something thats possible for youdoing something meaningful and giving yourself purpose and all that;weak
im glad that it helped you ;weak
for what worth it probably mean much coming from a complete stranger but glad it failed or the world would have just lost 1 more good person and we are low on them as is you can pm me anytime if you wanna talk;strong
yea why i dont text anymore all people want to hear is fake surface superficial shit;no
hmu if you want to talk;weak
