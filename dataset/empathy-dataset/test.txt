i suggest consulting a doctor before working your way off it though. doing it without proper planning might actually cause really bad physical side effects, or even increase the risk of developing suicidal thoughts. its not easy man... but i really hope one day manage to be completely off it :-);weak
So true. Every time I think I've made a friend, a few weeks/months later, life is like, haha, gotcha! At this point I don't like trying. I want to cut off everyone (not that I have to try that hard, lol) and just be alone, but then when loneliness gets to me, it hurts physically and I hate that.;no
Is your family having money trouble?;no
Just let it out then, that's what this is place is for. Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :);strong
When I can't sleep I've taught myself to use it. If I can concentrate I read, if I can't I play video games. Anything that helps me to relax. I tend to find that I need to distract myself from being unable to sleep, otherwise it makes me anxious and that makes the sleeplessness worse.;no
If you are into video games you could watch streams on twitch, find some favorite streamers. It really helps against loneliness.;no
In my experience, when meds start working, you slowly start having good days now and then. You may get like two good days, three bad days, some good days again etc. Until you keep getting more and longer stretches of good days. For me it's actually a sign that the meds are working. Don't worry about work too much, your health is more important and is your priority right now.;weak
There is no painless way to die. That's just how it is.;no
I'm sorry you're feeling unwell. I can't sleep either. I've been having a couple nights of unrest. I hope you're having better luck than I am. Also, stay strong. I know it's hard and it's a long journey but the fact that you want to stop is a start. Sleep well.;strong
Everyone die. Maybe you will die from lung cancer too. Its LIFE. For girl you can fix this easy. Explain what you feel about her. And parents always mad in every family, like my mom;no
Thats pretty awesome dude smiling is fun.;strong
Does there need to be a reason? Depression is an illness, and like any other illness it doesn't need some form of justification, it just *is*;no
I feel the same. I'm sorry.;strong
Hey man if you ever need to talk to anyone im here. Anytime. I know its not much but people do wanna help and genuinely care.;weak
I trust my dogs and cats more than humans. Humans are fallible. Animals are just who they are. When it comes to trust in humans, it comes down to expectations. What are your expectations? When you enter into a relationship, it is something you should talk about. If you don't, you will find that everyone has different expectations. And you will never find a relationship in which you can trust.;no
Homosexuality hasn't been considered a disease for awhile now O_o;no
Been there... but can I give a really cool trick that might truly help? When looking for a job, try to find a new store/restaurant/place opening up. No matter what it is... It was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening, everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together, instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc... anyway, what worked for me in the end. Either way, keep trying. Taking it one step at a time.. fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews. If you get too anxious and go then go, but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go. And if you start working and like it, ok, you can look elsewhere. So just keep pushing along.;weak
Nope, humans are naturally apathetic. If they noticed you're gone, it was likely a passing thing. You're golden trust me.;weak
I'm so sorry, grah88. I hope your grief doesn't overwhelm you. You can get through this and I'm rooting for you.;strong
Tell them that you appreciate their support, but feel that you aren't sure if cheering up will help in your situation. They'll understand.;weak
just a stranger on the internet, but not alone. here to listen.;weak
Ways to help are different for everybody, but calling them up and asking them if they'd be into a pizza and GOT (or something like that) night would help out a lot.;no
"Well I'll be here if you'd like to talk, though I may be too young as I'm only 14, though I understand what your feeling &amp; it's terrible. Hopefully it'll get better for us sooner or later, anyway I wish you the best of luck";weak
I'm sorry you are feeling this way. We are here for you.;strong
I haven't had human affection for 16years.;no
No, that is just really bad withdrawal. Don't confuse that for how you were without them.;no
We often ask that question out of habit and rarely out of genuine interest in the answer. It feels unnatural to say anything other than good or fine and we don't expect a different answer than that from anyone else. It's weird that we even ask when you think about it...;no
Hey, I just completed my EMT cert. Part of it we had to do an ambulance rotation and were paired with paramedics for a while. Honestly, the things that I got from my experience in EMT class and doing the ride along is that there are a lot of pretty stupid, not very competent, or physically fit people out there doing it. Im not saying that you wouldn't have to change anything, but like I guarantee that you could do it if you want to and would be better at it than some of the people out there working.;weak
That's terrible. I can understand the struggle they must be. This world is not sustainable for a lot of people.;weak
Why even care what random people think of you? likely go crazy worrying about that stuff;no
I'm sorry that haopened. I've never had a breakup because I always get rejected. I've had similar things so I can at least get an idea of how that must feel. But I believe you can find another girl you live.;strong
I read it. Oh my God me too. I'm so pessimistic I always shoot down my own happiness just by having my brain think. And whenever I am positive I want to vomit. SIGH frickin life;strong
I hear you on that. I make a mistake at work and I feel like I deserve physical pain. :/ I know intellectually it's not true, and it's easy for me to say you don't deserve pain for small human mistakes like everyone makes, but believing it in my subconscious is harder.;weak
Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case. I think it's more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at! Most people don't have that. Just keep practicing and never give up. If you have the drive you will succeed eventually. You'll get better and better every day.;weak
I'm just waiting until I turn 21 so I can buy my own alcohol and spend the next year killing my liver. I think 22 will be my last year but sometimes I don't even think I can make it there.;no
I was the smart kid getting straight As. Now I struggle to get Cs.;no
I know that feels, it probably will disappear one day. Just give it some time.;weak
Watch anything about Jim Carey and his philosophical beliefs. He considers depression as deep rest, you denying and separating a part of yourself from you as you move forward and grow.;no
I can relate, it sucks so bad because you know it isn't something you can ever change. The only thing you can do is change the skin and hair, but the actual face stays the same. Regarding the rest of my body though I started working out and that helped a lot. If weight is the problem start small and work your way up, or down I guess.;weak
I'm so sorry, grah88. I hope your grief doesn't overwhelm you. You can get through this and I'm rooting for you.;strong
Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe. I went out of it over two and a half years, and I hadn't ever known about these kinds of things until I was 19. Just trying to say it can be done man. Love you;strong
Here is the thing. If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you. (This isn't to say you can't have acquaintances, people you hang out with, but never get deep);weak
what are the finals you're Scared about;no
I'm very sorry that happened to you - I know the pain of loving someone and not having them love you back - How long have you back feeling depressed for?;strong
A voice in my head whispers your nothing, failure, everyone hates you. But in the quiet it's like they're screaming in my ears. It makes doing anything so hard. I just wanna sit and cry but I can't even do that right;no
I try to do that at least once a week. If its too cold outside then i just lay on a carpet, or take a really long bath.;no
Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions. What emotion are you experiencing right now? How do you identify it? What caused you to feel like this? What steps can you make to prevent this feeling? Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future.;strong
Man, you feel short because you live in Sweden. There is some hope you because you are still young. I recommend joining a college and going through counciling. Your hight is not everything. From reading your posts, I know you care about people and video games. Sweden is prolific when it comes to video game design. You could write a game that speaks to people, like Detroit spoke to you. Give yourself a chance. You can do something beautiful. Start small everyone else does. Sweden is also an amazing looking country. Check out a natural trail.;weak
Honestly I think you should just discuss this with him, even if it's in an indirect way like through text or email. Get your feelings out. If he's supportive, great, see if you can work things out. If he's not, take care of your own needs first.;no
You are seen! We care about you here. Its not always a booming because everyone is so sad themselves but we look out for eachother here;weak
Heh. The thought of suicide is what I sometimes turn to at night to help me sleep. The thought of ending it all is just so strangely comforting, like nDad's grilled cheese sandwiches or my sisters voice. It's even calmed me down when I've been laying in bed, sobbing hysterically.;no
I'll be honest, I feel kinda sorry for you. You have completely nobody? Perhaps you had some people, but due to some things those relationships didn't work out?;strong
Sorry mate but I don't think there's a way;no
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! (is doing *weird* things with my formatting.)  It's your birthday. You can be any way you want. You can want people to make a big deal even if you are depressed and want to not let them at the same time. You day, your rules. Happy happy 19:);strong
Luckily, I'm content at night. Can lay in the dark and do nothing. It's peaceful;no
I'm sorry you're feeling so blue today. I want to wish you a happy birthday and send some massively big hugs to you.;strong
I'm sorry. I hope you get a good day soon.;strong
Yes. I'm going through this exact scenario right now. It's causing me to question my entire reality with him. It's such an earth shattering feeling. Like, what else can I not trust in my world? The worst part was that in my gut, I knew it. I've known it for longer than I've wanted to admit. I just hoped I was wrong and let myself get sucked in even further. I believed all the bullshit just because maybe he meant it when he told me he loved me. He didn't mean it. I can't comprehend doing that to someone I loved. So I totally understand how you feel. I'm here if you want to talk.;weak
sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?;strong
Chill man high school isn't that bad all you have to do is just be chill and if you don't want to talk to anyone that's fine but eventually someone will want to talk to you that's just how it is :);strong
hey, do you need someone to talk to?;weak
Ah I'm sorry :( Panic attack are awful but you certainly shouldn't feel embarrassed!;strong
does it happen for a reason?;no
Woah... that's accurate. The posts in this sub today really reflect me. This is very truthful, I just live with it;strong
I'm glad it worked for you. I've been going for a few weeks and so far it hasnt helped, so good that it helps some people;strong
I do this too, only when I'm alone in the car.;no
I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been dealing with depression? Life is indeed very messy and hard. I'd hang out with you and buy you a drink and listen to your story if I could.;strong
Same here. How do I cope with it? Hmm I think I just resigned in getting a girlfriend or better finding 'true love'. I'm just getting sick when I see couples and wish to exit the world. I read somewhere that you should love yourself first and then love follows along or something like that. It's very hard to me because I feel like a piece of shid. Well atleast I have series and animes to kill my time.;no
I'm sorry for however long you still have to deal with them, but some day you will be able to walk away from them if you choose to, and that is 100% okay. You are your own very awesome person and they don't get a say in who you are.;strong
Everyone's problems are real. It's not a contest. If something is bothering you, then it's a problem. It doesn't matter if others have it worse. Emotions don't work like that. You wouldn't say Well, I was happy, but everyone seems happier, so I guess I'm not happy. Your feelings are just as important and valid as anyone else's.;weak
Join the club... On a more serious note, killing yourself would be really selfish. There are people out there that care about u whether u see it or not. It's not all about u.;weak
I'm really sorry for this. I'm going through something similar and I have pretty much given up all hope that I am the same as my peers. I am definitely not. I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill. After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time.;strong
**hugs if you want them**;strong
Is it sad that one of the biggest reasons I haven't killed myself yet is anticipation for future games?;no
idk what a Red pill means exactly but my advice to you is if she treating you right then fuck her there are billions of other girls out there, and if u feel like in love with her and just leave her then try to not care and you have to accept the fact that some girls(as well as some guys) will lie straight to your face for years without any remorse. my advice is stop caring before too late.;no
"I sometimes wish for the same thing. That some random event would end my life for me. Like a drunk driver or a meteor falling from the sky and hitting me. &amp;#x200B; It could happen. Who knows what the future holds? But, if I have to do it myself, so be it. &amp;#x200B; Good luck with no longer feeling this way.";no
Same honestly. Half the time I feel like overreacting and because of that I feel like a little bitch which brings me down more.;no
Kind of like you're a walking zombie? That's why I got off it, I felt that it helped with my emotions, by completely eliminating any emotions I could feel.;no
Shit, dude, I'm in my 40s and still rely on my parents for lots of shit. Wait... I might be a loser....;no
I mean to change any decision you might be considering, but as someone who has just finished their first semester, I just wanted to let you know that I really struggled. It was so taxing on my anxiety that I literally had nothing left to give a little over halfway through. The sad thing is that the work hard at all. if I got burned out my first semester, not having high hopes for when things really ramp up.;no
Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything.;strong
Especially family, they flip right the fuck out. I'd care, too. Don't do it, astresc.;weak
I feel you. I'm only happy and at ease when I'm drunk. I'm sure I'd drink a lot more if I had more disposable income.;weak
happy birthday!!! glad still here;weak
I'm so sorry you feel that pain. I know that pain all too well. That's amazing that you went so long without it! I can hardly manage three months, and I've been doing it for years. It's hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to. You are fine. People slip up here and there.;strong
Get her to a doctor and get her to tell them about it. They'll know what services are available to help her out.;no
I'm sorry your situation at home is so difficult. Do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how you're feeling?;strong
agree more, life is suffering sadly;weak
We are here if you need to talk to someone;weak
I'm sorry you feel this way. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?;strong
Thats pretty awesome dude smiling is fun.;strong
It s all about the he said she said bullshit;no

Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things.

Happy Birthday. I'm sorry your birthday is going less well than you hoped. I had kind of a rough start in high school too so I know how you feel better than most. I'm open to talk whenever you like.;strong
Thank you. That's so relatable.;no
Sorry to hear. I hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again.;strong

"I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin for the longest time and didn't have any bad side effects, but it definitely didn't help me as much as I'd hoped. It did get me from I can't leave my bed to I guess I can function occasionally on a good day. I'm no longer on the Lexapro but the Wellbutrin has stuck with me for a while, so. It went well for me; Hope it goes well for you!";weak
Well, if you looked at how those people spend their time. It would probably be very different than how you spend your time. So it kind of makes sense that they would have different results and resulting feelings about their life since their life is so different. But the good news is, you can have a happy, fuller life too. What you should do is list out the top five things you don't like about your life. Then you should spend some time working on the one that is bothering you the most. In my experience, when I was unhappy with my life it was because I was neglecting some part of my life that was really nagging me. Rooting for you! Hope this helps.;weak
so sorry my friend. I hope found something or someone to help you fill a part of that void.;strong
I wanna be lonely with you guys to. Here's one big lonely hug , squeeze hard might be the only one you get. I'm alone by myself oh so lonely, just want to feel close to another like myself, I'm blown away by the shear lone that has overcome me, will I ever break the chains that imprisoned me to lonliness. Am I to endure this for the rest of my life?;strong
I'm so happy for you! This is definitely a good sign.;strong
Yeah that's the idea behind it, you basically just condition yourself like a dog. Fuck that;no
Why do you feel like that? It makes me sad to read something like that, often the good people in this world have the most troubles, but please dont give up.;weak
thanks, friend. do the same for you.;weak
"Same, and I go to an expensive university so I feel even more like a waste because I can't find my passion like those around me. But I've been told it doesnt actually matter despite the gaping hole inside me. Hope you are ok&lt;3";weak
so sorry my friend. I hope found something or someone to help you fill a part of that void.;strong
"Your attitude is what we need more. Society has its 'standards' that actually make us unhappy. Embrace who you are with all the bright and dark sides and don't force yourself to hide the dark sides; that's what we're taught to do but it's the root for unhappiness.";no
My dear, sometimes you've gotta learn to comfort yourself. I had to recently. All I wanted was someone to just be there and tell me everything is going to be ok. The one person I needed to tell me this, never came. You have to be your own hero. You are a strong human.;weak
I feel the same. I'm sorry.;strong
I lost myself a long time ago.;no
"About a week ago I was damn near rock bottom and told one of my closer friends that I was seriously considering suicide, and needed a reason to not go through. This is a long ass quote, but it helped me. It's somewhat personal, but I think the message can be applied to anyone &gt;Life is bullshit and it's full of the shittiest people. I suffered from major depression but I also live by a philosophy. Life is so bullshit - but it's those small moments that make it worth it. Those small, sometimes dumb, moments where you just smile thinking about it. Our conversations, graduating school, seeing a new member in your family being born. It's the small things that bind us together and make it worth the suffering &gt;It hurts like fucking hell. But this life was worth having if it mean[s] coming in and making you smile, even once. Making someone's day. Being in someone's life....";no
Because you'll miss the beautiful moments ahead of you that are just waiting for you to witness them;no
Sorry to hear that, feel free to PM if you want to.;strong
Dude. This feeling, I know it, and sadly, this is a common go-to response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute. It's out of context and beside the point in essence. It's a variation of the ever popular At least you aren't a starving kid in [insert country here]! and more generally It could be worse! Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point? It's invalidating, insensitive and snobby, at best, and I have no idea if it helps you feel any better, but when a lot of people say it, they do think they're doing some genuine good to help you feel better, despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is. My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said. In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it.;strong
I don't think that's weird at all. Just don't forget that you're still the same person you were before you changed how you think of yourself.;weak
you forgot, you still have yourself. you're not worthless just because you don't have any money. don't stay for your brothers. stay for yourself. this sounds but there is stuff worth staying for. the shitty truth is if we kill ourselves, people mourn for a day, then move on and forget us. our life briefly becomes a public spectacle. people spout shit like ohh what a sweet person, shame they died. they won't say that they were the ones who ignored us when we were alive and suffering. THEY WILL FORGET YOU. so stay the fuck alive, and make them notice you because you deserve to be noticed. worthlessness usually stems from lack of accomplishment. if that applies to you, start learning or doing something. anything that interests you. just give it your all. but don't die just yet. you will, eventually, so why hurry. so for now, look in the mirror every time you feel you're alone, and remind yourself you're not.;weak
I'm always focused on myself. Even when people are talking to me- I'm too focused on how they are actually perceiving me than listening to then;no
I'm so sorry, I understand your loss. My grandma just passed away on 05/26. It's hard to accept that we will never spend time with them again and that everything we have now is just our memories. I know it seems cliche, but it really does get better with time.;strong
As someone with ADHD too, I have whole days where things feel like they're fine, but attempting to do anything to fix my situation generally drains me and leaves me agitated and snippy. I feel like an inpatient, able to roam the fluorescent halls, but unable to go outside.;no
Well fair enough. I'm sorry there isn't anything I can say to help :/;strong
so sorry my friend. I hope found something or someone to help you fill a part of that void.;strong
Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything.;strong
I get showered and dressed every day. It's a habit I work hard not to break, just so I can go out if I'm able. It definitely helps me;no
Im always here for you;weak
LMAO you have no clue what your'e talking about.;no
I have worried about that a lot. I inherited my depression from my mom. She could be pretty fucking terrible but the things that made her terrible had nothing to do with depression. I wish she had never had me, but aside from that, I just wish she had done more self care. She spent every waking hour at work or driving us to some activity. I wish she had instead slept and meditated and exercised for herself and stuff.;no
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! (is doing *weird* things with my formatting.)  It's your birthday. You can be any way you want. You can want people to make a big deal even if you are depressed and want to not let them at the same time. You day, your rules. Happy happy 19:);strong
Holy shit I can relate so well to this.;strong
It happens. It used to happen a lot for me in my final year of uni. Best thing for me was to call someone and they'd talk me down. It's not easy to study when you're crying, shaking and hyperventilating :/;weak
Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you.;no
Have you looked into getting help?;no
agree more, life is suffering sadly;weak
Fuck today. Go back to bed!;no
Don't end your life, change your life. Take control and only accept the good things YOU want in your life. Somebody calls you with some bullshit...hit the bullshit button (click) and keep on moving ahead. The same with real life. You don't HAVE to accept anything in your life you don't want to. It's your mind, control it or focus it on what you want to focus it on. Get a goal, get a plan, and get off your ass. Hope some of that helps.;weak
I've definatley been there, but if I've learned anything through my depression, deployments, college and life in general is that it always gets worse before it start s to get better. And I know how cliche that might sound but I can vouch for it. Life isn't going to be easy, whoever says it is, is fucking lying. Life is about perception, mentality over reality. You are strong enough to survive, you can make it, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't let people, or work, or circumstance dictate you. Only let yourself dictate who you are. You can do this;weak
I'm so sorry you're going through this.. My dog passed away two months ago so I know how painful it is :( I adopted another dog, I was still upset but it definitely helped me with the grieving process.;strong
I think I can relate to what you're saying. I feel like a big part of my depression is loneliness. I can't make friends. I want friends but even when I put myself out there, I can't say anything. It's like my mouth is taped shut. Makes me uncomfortable so I leave. Then I feel lonely, then I try to put myself out there... the whole cycle starts again. I've tried sports clubs, and other extracurriculars. I guess I just wasn't meant to have friends.;no
I'm sorry you're feeling like that. I know it sounds grim as fuck, but if you broke the record for suicidal thoughts? It also means you've broken the record for resisting suicidal thoughts, and that's something to be proud of - even if it doesn't feel like it just now;strong
its ok to be sad,the important thing is to beat all the motherfuckers who says that;weak
*hug* Whatever the situation is that's causing you to feel this way, please remember to exercise compassion towards yourself.;strong
Feeling at rock bottom is not selfish. When you continually feel like that, something is wrong and should be sorted. Dojt worry what others think. You are important. I've learned this;weak
Yeah also feel numb often. Wanna talk about it?;weak
I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help. *-hugs-*;strong
Yes. I will never tell anybody about my depression. Kinda sucks;no
I know you're getting down voted, but I don't want you to focus on that. The guilt is worse than the depression. Not only do you feel terrible, but then you're made to feel guilty for feeling so. (Doesn't any one understand that if we could help it, we would??). I get it. Chin up. :);weak

hell yes thats a win! Keep fighting and try running some laps. It'll make you feel great!;weak
You are not a fraud, your are worthy. Also, abrupt change of tone, what does sme mean?;weak
that be nice? I am in the same boat...for about the last 8 years it just keeps getting worse. I am sorry you are going through it too...I am not real hopeful about it getting better for me anytime soon, but I really hope it does for you. it strange that we can believe it can for someone else, a complete stranger on the internet, but not for ourselves? If not happiness, I hope you can find at least some peace and comfort in 2019.;strong
Try thinking good thought. How many women will you please with your grin if you had nice clean teeth?;no
Well done, you've shattered the illusion :) But where are you trying to make it? Where are you going? Sometimes we all have to fake the way we are in order to get where we need to be, or get to what we want. But other times, all that effort is so dragged on and futile because we are working to satisfy some expectation. Then at the end of the day, satisfying the expectation is underwhelming--dissatisfying to its core. Then we just think, ok, now what? Just this post is poetic enough to make me think that you've got some fancy talents locked up in that head of yours. I wish you luck my friend, I bet you can make something of yourself, even if you struggle to believe it. And chances are, you've probably already done some neat things, and I hope you've taken the time to appreciate these accomplishments. I'm wishing you fantastic luck.;weak
I know the feeling. I'm just so tired. I don't want to play this game anymore;weak
i know this feeling it sucks so hard, you should try meditating like breath 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out for a long time and you will feel a bit better;weak
I was a chef so it was natural for me to have cuts and burns. Nobody ever figured out I was doing it on purpose. I hope you're getting the help you need.;weak
Just let it out then, that's what this is place is for. Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :);strong
Yes! Dating can get you out of depression. Not without medical attention though. I'd tell from the get go;weak
taught me one main lesson: Life fucking sucks.;no
Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything.;strong
The only thing making me hesitant is my family. Seven siblings, four of them younger than me, and nothing scares me more than one of the little kids having to go through something that can leave them traumatized. On top of that, money is a big problem right now and I don't want my parents to have to deal with the costs. I feel so freaking stuck.;no
Sometimes I wake up and I immediately feel like I need to go back to sleep.;no
It's the first new show in several years that seems interesting at all to me. Just when everyone was worrying about hbo;no
I have major issues with sleeping too much. I can't sleep when I want to at night and then I sleep all day. I set an alarm to wake me up at 12 and usually snooze it for an hour. If I turn it off then I don't get up until 4PM. I can't say I get any sort of fog feeling though, just incredibly tired.;no
It's true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon. We've gone very far into the illusions of separation and it's going to take some time to break through these, but it's going to happen I have no doubt anymore! I'm sending you love and hugs through the wire even if it's only designed for 0 and 1, feel it!;strong
Inactivity is the cause for depression and depression causes inactivity. Seek to get out of your cycle, bit by bit.;no
I'm sorry for your pain. Wanna talk?;strong
"Hey. I know who you are, what doing or even thinking right now, but I do hope that still here for now at least, and reading this comment. really sorry for how feeling right now, and even though been through this for the last 2 years already, I say that I understand how you feel; even though I wish that I could. But please, please know that if you still need to talk, you could message me yeah? This truly is a really shitty world; but in light of all this, there are still people who are genuinely kind, who would really want to help. Being a beacon of light for those who are still suffering and letting the light from others shine onto you; this the purpose of living? The purpose of still staying here?";strong
ive just sat in my room crying my eyes out thinking mostly about this. Conversations with people ive known my whole life i find difficult, its not natural. Everything feels so forced! im sick of trying so so hard to look normal. I hide my feelings from absolutely everyone and im exhausted. No motivation in life, feel like im a waste of skin;no
Why did you want to commit suicide?;no
"Maybe one day. as you dream, things will get better. Hopefully. but mostly i believe you are the only one who can make things better. If you are feeling like talking. I'm here. &lt;3. :)";weak
Aww you are so lucky to have her by your side..! Inspirational;strong
That's it. You've discovered how things work. What now?;no
I even put up with bad books. Anything that gets me thinking about something else.;no
As someone who's felt the same, what do you have? And I'm speaking objectively, because I typically don't want to admit that I have what I need when I feel as you do. Not that I'm saying that you do have a lot, but your post doesn't necessarily shed a lot of light on what's going on. It's easy, or it has been for me, at least, to say that I don't know what to live for, in the past. Somebody out there cares, man/woman, small or large. I don't know what your situation is, by your post, but feel free to message me if you want.;weak
Don't know if it helps in the long run but apps with binaural beats might help. They worked the first time for me, but my body got used to it later on.;no
Good morning bro, im happy that you woke up and read this comment! I hope you have a great day today!;strong
I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been dealing with depression? Life is indeed very messy and hard. I'd hang out with you and buy you a drink and listen to your story if I could.;strong
People are being exposed to the harsh reality of life earlier, thanks to the availability and ease of access of information.;no
I'm so sorry. Are u ok;strong
"I would love to hug you irl ;_; *hugs*";weak
The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love!;weak
Dear Anna_rampage. Thank you for your kind words. I'm just a regular lonely nobody, but it means the world for me to hear that. That someone really cares. Thank you so much =) It brighten my day.;strong
my advice, dont fall in love with any one. Losing love is the worst feeling i the world. Just dont do it. Stop now while you can. You are better off alone.;no
If pushing you to do it, yeah file a complaint. If they know suicidal and just their mindset, I see you benefiting from it at all. assuming in the USA.;no
Yea, things go more wrong when happy. Kind of. Really I just get more nervous because I suddenly have that happiness to lose. When Im depressed it is what it is, but when like carrying a bag of money through a bad neighbourhood at let me lose lol. I be happy if not risking something. The risk and fear of losing the happiness, is part of how I feel good. Like, I feel proud that willing to take that risk. If that makes sense? Be careful with music, powerful. I have stuff I listen to because so good at effecting how I feel. Also, your brain releases a lot of chemicals when happy for the first time in a while, if ever had an extreme sugar rush, or done cocaine lol, it can be overwhelming. normal though.;no
Yeah, really. I was looking into how much of my sleeping pill I'd need to take to overdose and it turns out I'd need 300 of them for a lethal dose.;no
I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better.;strong
I feel the exact same way as you do and I'm tell my self that I'm fine. If ever want to talk about PM. I feel when you talk about your lonliness it helps to get through. I use discord and WhatsApp if that's your thing. Don't be to hard on yourself everyone in the world is loved by someone.;weak
I get where you are coming from. I don't feel cold. I feel hollow and my insides are black.;no
It definitely is the small things sometimes. Way to go!;no
Everything is pointless and hopeless I was born broken and forever unable to feel happiness please end me now I can't do this anymore. I had to let that out. Sorry. I hope you find meaning in your days, OP. I've given up myself, but I really, really hate to see other people feel this way. Life is so hard. I things get better and easier for you.;weak
I know. I don't get it either. If most people were anything like me, human civilization would crumble - would never have started.;no
I suppose it depends on how deep the pattern is, something that help some people is to use a calendar and write down things to do during which hours everyday in advance and try to force yourself to not break the schedule. Doesn't work for me but i know that it works for some people. The most important part i'd say is to find a goal to strive towards.;no
I'm sorry you're feeling like that. I know it sounds grim as fuck, but if you broke the record for suicidal thoughts? It also means you've broken the record for resisting suicidal thoughts, and that's something to be proud of - even if it doesn't feel like it just now;strong
We all are, and that's ok.;weak
I'm sorry. I wish I could help. I feel the same way.;strong
Hey, i think for the upside of it, your coworkers are genuinely concern for your wellbeing which is nice. And if you're doing a great job at your work then there's still chances of promoting! Taking care of yourself comes first always!;no
Life isn't about anything (or maybe it is?), but I think what makes it meaningful are the little moments, the little things. Like a cup of tea on a chilly day, petting your dog while lying in a soft bed, this sort of stuff. Unfortunately they don't make the hardships and the sadness any easier.;no
Maybe it would exhaust them more over time. But the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt. They may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves. They will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life. Talk with your family, work through it together, accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you. It will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier.;weak
*hug* I can't remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either, I need a hug or a cuddle so bad, the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me. I feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time. I don't know how long I can go on. Best of luck!;strong
I support and am thankful for you, friend.;weak
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?;strong
hey guys, another one of you guys here. lets all vent to each other? lets spit some emotions out. i feel hopeless. helpless. alone. empty.;no
What responsibility? Why is that a responsibility. Did someone give it to you?;no
Do you mean your bad days feel worse or do you mean you feel bad and good at the same time? Ever since this thing started for me I had fluctuations over the course of the day, days and weeks, where I would have lethargy, tiredness and depression in the mornings for example and then good feelings and even excitement and a lot of energy in the evenings. Also I have very good days/ weeks and suddenly it hits me again. Did you have constant depression and how bad was it?;no
I don't wanna get up at all either but I have a stupid appointment to go to.;no
Let's start from the beginning. Is there anything triggering this currently that you can think of? How long have you felt this way?;no
It's normal, don't worry too much about it.;weak
Hey, I've been feeling pretty lonely and down myself. Love the name by the way;no
Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions. What emotion are you experiencing right now? How do you identify it? What caused you to feel like this? What steps can you make to prevent this feeling? Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future.;strong
Same, well obviosuly I don't know how you feel 100% but I thinks its appropiate to say I can relate to you deeply. Why don't we try distract ourselves, even if its just 5 mins. Listen to a song you like, watch a small video, browse r/eyebleach or even go drink water. Im gonna try and watch something in youtube to at least try and not think about you know what. Wannna try with me? :);weak
I feel the same and i think its because i have nobody to talk to, nobody to be vulnerable to and let them know how i feel inside. Why dont you try to talk to your girlfriend, i bet if she'd new she'd try to help. Open up to her! Hope it goes well :);weak
"You writing this &amp; still being here I think that's a good sign,I think it means that deep down there's still hope that things will get better &amp; you'll start feeling happier &amp; less lonely, hold on to that feeling &amp; if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me.";weak
I wanna be lonely with you guys to. Here's one big lonely hug , squeeze hard might be the only one you get. I'm alone by myself oh so lonely, just want to feel close to another like myself, I'm blown away by the shear lone that has overcome me, will I ever break the chains that imprisoned me to lonliness. Am I to endure this for the rest of my life?;strong
Yeah man I can relate. Especially with the crying and screaming thing. I wonder what's stopping us from crying? And what's worse is I've even had friends comment on how I don't get upset easily or mad about certain things that are usually normal to be mad about. But how can I if I don't even feel like I'm a real human being, yah know? I wish we could escape the void inside ourselves.;weak
I'm not very happy but I distract myself with hobbies and projects. I'm just used to being single.;no
At the last minutes i kinda regret it, especially if i had to fall asleep while it's the dawn, i hate dawn. I have noticed that i sleep much better during the day, i even fall asleep easily during a day, even if i keep the normal mode of awake/sleeping.;no
My boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday. The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so. But you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life. Become strong from this.;weak
I hate Halloween because I'm not so fucking fascinated with pop culture (I'm a miserable pretentious douchebag.) This big deal Halloween party I didn't go to this year is just a bunch of cosplayers walking around in a warehouse going oh, what are you? Cooool great job! And then awkwardly moving on because you don't actually know anyone. Just these alienated masks, colors and bodies.;no
Then makes some, and create your own future. Not the one you think people expect of you;no
At some level I still think it is a choice. A million different choices. For me at least. On my bad days/weeks/months/years I am so paralyzed by anxiety and depression and apathy for living that I sleep all day and avoid everything. I avoid life. I want do die, but am too lazy to do anything about it. When I take initiative to do things, work on a project, clean stuff, I feel so much better. I loose myself in my task and all those heavy feelings of hopelessness stay away for awhile. Maybe it is just me, maybe I am just lazy. Idk, but that is my life experience.;no
So sorry for your loss;strong
I feel that way, but somehow I always manage to lose even more if someone insults me, so clearly I've got some buried somewhere. I wish I could just have no self-esteem, so that I could get that insult immunity, but nope, whenever I think I'm out I find more to lose.;weak
Rather than seeing an entire population, you are seeing a narrowed down group based upon one specific topic. It may seem hat there are a lot of relationship and family conflicts posted about here because those are large factors in depression. There is no one cause to depression. It stems from a multitude of factors both biological and environmental. Past and present experiences, genetics, predesposed vulnerabilities, social connections, all play a role.;no
so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.;strong
Holy shit I can relate so well to this.;strong
This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues. Meditation is the single most powerful tool i've found.;no
Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.;weak
Only you can answer the question. I personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life. Though I agree that the hamster wheel and rat-race pretty sucks, but I just don't see much alternative at this point if I want to keep doing what I do now...;weak
Yes right. So my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me I will be better once through it. So the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time. See to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical. Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way. But we because we have been here before and got through it-and we were happy again-and bam we are here now. But we will be happy again. You know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lol...like for real. That is the break through-realizing that it fucking sucks sometimes. So what, supposed too...because that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha. I hope you feel better all I wish for you!!!;weak
What do you enjoy doing in your free time. Sitting around being depressed doesn't make for good story-telling. At least it didnt for me. Also, please don't apologize. We absolutely want to hear how you're feeling on this sub and it's beneficial to see and hear other people's perspectives going through this hell.;weak
I hear you. So well. And I'm so sorry you feel that way. I left my difficult-to-get-into art school because of this (and my classmates treated it like high school and were jerks, but thats irrelevant). It's not easy.;strong
No you are not a loser in any way. Admiring your depression shows how strong you are. This is something that is hard to get rid of. Believe me I know. important is that you give up and keep moving forward a strong and special person. I believe in you. Have hope. *hug*;weak
I'm sorry you feel like this. My daughter has tried to kill herself 3 times and I pretty much have been mentally preparing myself for the worst for the last 6 months bc she was so so depressed and non responsive to meds, therapy etc. Then the craziest thing happened...she got involved in an old hobby, met new people she had stuff in common with, and just 5 minutes ago told me that she is going out to lunch with someone from that group. My point is...things can change. I hope things can change for you soon.;strong
*hug* I can't remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either, I need a hug or a cuddle so bad, the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me. I feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time. I don't know how long I can go on. Best of luck!;strong
Im so so sorry for your lose! *big big hugs*;strong
Can you talk about whats going on in your head? Maybe if you get it out, it will be a little more sorted? I'm sorry it's so overwhelming right now. Someone loves you, they just don't know how to show it the right way, right now.;strong
I'm sorry your situation at home is so difficult. Do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how you're feeling?;strong
I'm on mirtazapine at the moment and, I too, am having issues dealing with the fatigue. I Spoke to my psychiatrist about it and they said that mirtazapine stimulates both an anti-histamine effect and a noroadrenaline effect. The anti-histamine effect causing the fatigue. However, once you start taking 30mg daily the noroadrenaline effect outweighs the anti-histamine effect and you should feel a lot less fatigue.;no
I feel you, I'm in the same situation. My depression and anxiety is just good enough for me to be in uni or work, but never good enough for me to keep the job or do good in school.;no
I hate when people say things like that. Why on earth would I choose to feel this way?;no
I am guilty that I just want to find my own night but all I can say is I hope you make it through one more night. I don't know why. I wish the utmost pain and death on myself but I pray that others survive. Depression truly kills one's sanity and mind.;weak
I feel you there and I am so sorry! Those people suck!;strong
Maybe because the devil you know is better then the one you dont. I would say maybe you're afraid of what may happen... so much that you would rather endure what you have rather than gamble. Any of this sound right? What bad situation are you in? Would you like to talk? I'm here if you do :) pm or reply on here :);weak
Move to Australia. winter there;no
Please don't. Its just not right choice make. There is always something that can be done other than that.;strong
What makes you happy now? Or at least what distracts you from how much you hate yourself? (Sometimes that's as close to happiness as I can get);no
If you were here I would hug you right now.;strong
Yea. Sorry. I know how you feel. feeling very alone today.;strong
Your mom sounds verbally abusive. I'm sorry you feel like this. I hope things get better for you soon.;strong
I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful;strong
Do you care about excitement at all or no?;no
I'd say shooting yourself in head with a shotgun. But think about 'might happen' consequences. Your soul.. being born again.. idk isnt there really anything you can do about your desperate situation? Whats up man;no
Have you tried joining in and failed? I know how that feels man Im sorry;weak
Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe. I went out of it over two and a half years, and I hadn't ever known about these kinds of things until I was 19. Just trying to say it can be done man. Love you;strong
I feel ya.. Hope that you'll get through this moment in time.;weak
I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful;strong
Yeah, I resonate with a lot of what you're saying. It's only on a place like here or a depression support group that you would find others that feel this way. Let me ask you this: what do you find joy or distraction in? Tell me everything you have tried.;weak
I feel that way often when I go out by myself without my husband or mom with me. So you're not alone. My fear is a combination of the shit my parents told me as a kid and my obsession with crime television. It's a good day when I can go out by myself and be calm.;no
Hi, I hope you are doing okay today. If you have never scene anyone, I would recommend a therapist like a LCSW (licensed social worker). In my experience, the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider. So I over think it too hard. Instead, put that energy towards finding the right person. Which means calling lots of places, talking to a lot of people and listening to your gut. Have a good one;weak
Just be ur self! Be true to who u r and wear what u want to wear, compare ur self to others because u will loose and forget who u r. ur life so live life to the best of ur ability and worry about what anyone else thinks. Be ur self because u r the only u;weak

I envy you. I can only sleep like 4 hours a day;no
I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. A person can be cared for by dozens and still feel alone, depression is a monster. I hope you're able to make progress against it in your own way, or by talking to people you trust, living the life you want to live, or by obtaining professional help. Please send me a message if you would like to talk to someone privately.;strong
Good luck friend I wish you the best. There have been multiple times where I wondered if this was a good idea for me, but I have 3 pets at home so it could never be an option unless I were married or something. Lol. Anyway, know you are brave and I am so proud of you for taking initiative to help yourself. You deserve to get better and I believe in you!;weak
hey, do you need someone to talk to?;weak
Are you getting your results on the 10th or 17th of August? And did you write AS or A2?;no
I remember at 8/9 years old getting scolded for forgetting to brush my teeth and in the morning thereafter I started thinking about how much adults have to remember, how much they have to do in their lives. If I couldn't remember to brush my teeth every day (and I really kept trying) how would I remember to do anything else? How would I remember to learn, be good at school, how would I remember to do all the other things I kept forgetting? How could I be anything more than terrible, like I seemed to keep being. Even when I succeeded why did I always feel like I was so useless and bad at everything the moment I didn't? Why did it seem to keep getting worse? It was such a tiny thing, so inconsequential a moment, but a demon was born in my mind that day. He's lived there ever since.;no
What is something you can do that would feel healthy and bring you a sense of hope. Do you have a loving friend to reach out to? Do you have a pet you may be able to hang out with? A faith group that brings you peace? What's one thing you could do right now that would feel like a healthy step and would bring you some positive vibes.;no
I'm sorry. I hope you get a good day soon.;strong
Although you did express that thought and feeling in a clear and concise manner. Not sure if that helps but hey, it's the best I've got right now.;no
That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks.;weak
Ugh, tell me about it. Although i've been eating, just a lot less than normal,i still just want to lay here and just forget about everything, but laying down leaves me alone with my thoughts always thinking about what was. I've been trying to keep active to keep my mind on other things. You should give it a shot. Go out to a restaurant or something, just get out.;weak
As a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there. It is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college. I know what you're feeling, well actually mine was worse since I had little friends but if I could back and give myself advice I'd tell myself to man up and do well, work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now. Please believe in yourself and press forward. Although you have all the time in the world to make changes. Waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression. It's a problem you don't want to deal with when your older. It's best done in the present.;weak

I've read that the minimum lethal dose of hydroxyzine is 1650 mg, but that is impossible to calculate correctly because of body weight, differences in absorption, etc. With Luvox, full recovery with minimal effects has been noted at overdoses of up to 9 grams. You might be successful, especially if you are small and don't weigh much, but there is a not insignificant chance you might end up alive and brain damaged instead. I know I'm a stranger, but I am sorry about whatever has brought you to this point. Do consider trying to get help - even if you have before, think about it one last time.;strong
You are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and I think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings, im sorry i couldn't help more and hope you get better;strong
I'm sorry that you're also in this position. I'm honestly just waiting for my parents to die so I can kill myself.;strong
You are loved and you can get through this.;weak
Do you want to talk about it?  (I realized that sentence kinda sounds sarcastic wasn't meant to be);weak
Hang in there. You are not alone. Tell me what's going on.;weak
Yeah i feel ya its kinda like a part of a song that i once wrote every single night in my dreams i die waking up dissapointed im still alive;no
I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good. I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points. And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto. I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot. Pm me if you ever wanna chat about whatever. Your energy doesn't affect mine.;strong
I know how it feels man. It sucks. terrible to hear and sorry :(;weak
Same. And im not gonna stop failing anytime soon;no
Sorry you are feeling that way but How do you know it was a lie? In My experience most people don't compliment unless they meant it. Excluding family or friends who may just be telling u what they think u wanna hear of course. Who complimented you and in what context?;strong
I know the feeling. It hurts to think of our missed opportunities and how we failed to express ourselves.. It hurts like hell to have to go through this over and over without changing.;weak
Im always here for you;weak
I ran away two times as a teenager. One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone.;no
How did the trauma come about?;no
it could be fatigue, it could be avoiding the anxiety/responsibility of dealing with others which is the case with me;no
Did you kill someone? Did you horribly abuse someone? Or is there a voice in your head just telling you that you don't deserve help?;no
Care to extrapolate on some positive examples of your brain rewiring? The only experience I have with this is my weed addiction since I was 16 and now I'm 20 :/. Only smoked once this last week tho so things are looking up;no
Pick one things you need or want to do. Relax, be calm, sit down. Focus on that one thing. Complete it. Feel good about completing it and then move on to the next task. Repeat until desired tasks are completed. Look back on the work you have done and congratulate yourself for being strong when things are hard. You can do this friend I truly believe in you.;weak
This actually sounds like me yesterday but with my boyfriend. Ended up talking to him and seeing how much he loves me despite all this really made me feel loved. Just like how my bf is, I believe your gf loves you for who you are. sell yourself short! The fact that you are trudging throng life despite fighting depression shows how strong of a person you are mentally~;weak
I'm proud of you! Even though I don't know you I truly am. Care for everything that's worth caring, you'll find it's more than it seems.;weak
This is known as SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder, or something like that. And yeah a bulb and natural lighting help out a lot;weak
Tell them that you appreciate their support, but feel that you aren't sure if cheering up will help in your situation. They'll understand.;weak
If you want someone to talk to I will be here. You can PM me if you want;weak
Sorry. I feel the same way. There's absolutely nothing in this life I want. It is kind of driving me crazy though because I don't know what to literally, actually do.;strong
He's laughing at all of us, that sick fuck.;no
I do. It's like you're on pause, but your problems aren't..;no
Hm. Try planning a trip to somewhere that you really wanted to go. That could work. If not, then try some form of meditation.;no
For at least the last 4 or 5 years I've also felt like there's not really any point in living, and yet.... I'm still here. If only to spite all the people who think you aren't strong enough to make it, There's always a reason to hang on :) you matter and you deserve good things.;weak
I've been going through this, quite recently. I told my teachers about my depression, it was really hard to open up to them, but they let me drop some assessments. I'll be picking up the assessments I dropped later in the year. Then again I'm in college (high school in the USA?).;no
Hey, I know how frustrating it feels when you have no one to reach out to.I am here for you if you want to talk, friend.;weak
Some days depression can be worse than others. Just try to make it until tomorrow. :);no
Lots of poems in the last couple days, always interesting to get an insight into someones thoughts.;no
You are in no way the odd man out. never once spoken to someone who have *something* that they worry about. Whether grades or work or their looks or their friends or personal achievements or their health or even something they said 5 years ago and still feel bad about. Everyone worries about something, and you or I are no exception. Everyone has two sides: the external self which they show to the world, and the internal self which they hide. All you are seeing is what they want you to see: their happiness and confidence and success. What they hide are their fears, their worries, their guilt, and even their unrealistic dreams. It may seem like the outsider looking in, but I promise you that what you are feeling is very ordinary and natural. You are not alone.;weak
Sometimes having friends isn't about them liking you, but rather that you like things that other people do. Like if you are really into something, say cars, than if you have a car and go to car meets or race, others will see this and know that you're the guy to know if they want to get into a car scene. Another example would be if you are really into books and people feel like reading something and know that you are into books, they might come to you for recommendations. Most friends bond over a subject before they ever get to know each other as anything more than people interested in the same thing.;no
I feel you man. I attempted suicide 3 times last year because I see the future really getting better, no matter how hard I try. why I hate when people say gets better, not because a raging pessimist. I hope this makes you feel at least a little better;weak
Well if it feels like another long stage depression, it's easier to get help now before it hits full force. Good luck and I'm sorry;strong
I'm not 'cured' but I'm a thousand times better than I used to be, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. The key has been little steps over a long time, unfortunately there are no quick fixes. Keep going, keep experimenting with treatments, there's one out there that'll work for you. You can do this!;weak
Me too, and I don't even believe in a god. Just do it on the chance I'm wrong;no
That solves nothing and will hurt your loved ones to no end. The road to recovery takes a long time and is so much hard work, but when you get there everything will change. Seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step. The second step is finding something, ANYTHING, to get out of bed for. For me it was my cat. I would go without eating for days because I didn't want to leave my house, and I didn't want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself. When my cat ran out of food I would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldn't be hungry. When he curled up with me I felt good, at a time that nothing else felt good. He passed a few months ago, but he flat out saved my life and I'm constantly grateful. Life can be overwhelming, especially when you feel the way you do. But you can make it better. Don't be afraid to ask for help.;weak
way to go. keep it up champ!;weak
Actually I get this a lot. Can't bake a fucking cake? Can't use the coffee machine without creating a mess? Can't make a stupid toast AND drop it? I don't know if it's helpful but right after such things happened I imagine how hundreds of other people on earth experience the same situation right now. Helps me sometimes.;weak
"&gt;Do you get depressed without a job? Yeah.I feel useless and like a burden for my family.What good I am for if I can't keep a simple job in a chocolate factory? &gt;What do you do during a day if not at work? Read self improvement articles,watch porn and masturbate,and clean my house. My advice for you you find yourself jobless is: # Do not waste your time. Do not lock yourself in your room and watch porn&amp;masturbate all long.Find something useful to do with your free time.Recharge your batteries.Start working out,you don't need to go to gym,just take a run in the morning and one in the evening.Build your emotional resilience.I do this by reading about it first (I am in the process of finding out what it means and then I have to apply it).A good start is r/Stoicism.Make yourself useful - clean your house and take care of your pets. After that start looking for another job and do not despair.";weak
That's hard. Especially if you're the type of person to post in this sub. Loving yourself is really difficult. But loving others is easier. And I do love you. When you love others, I find, its easier to love yourself. Even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good. I hope I helped.;strong
yes! so sorry that's happening to you, but it feels good to relate - I see a lot of posts about having great dreams. I have at least one bad dream almost every night - and the feeling *always* bleeds into my day, especially if it was confusing or made me question reality. I have dreams all the time about my little sisters getting hurt, and it makes me worry for them. just today I had some kind of sleep paralysis (I don't know if that's the right word, I looked it up but it didn't seem to fit) and honestly I'm scared to fall asleep tonight because I do not want it to happen again. it's happened several times and it terrifies me. you're not alone, friend.;strong
Definitely a daily struggle, but it seems like every day there's less and less reason to drag on.;weak
I was one year in collage but I realize that I didn't like how we studied there. I dicided I would try to studied something related with airplanes because I always love it. Now I have ended my studies and I'm going to do an internship in an airline. The most important thing is doing what you love.;weak
You're not alone with that.;weak
I feel the same. I'm sorry.;strong
Yeah. I'm afraid of a painful death. I'm afraid of dying itself. Does my consiousness just stop? Does it feel like before I was born? Is there something afterward? Both heaven and hell sound terrible. I don't want to stop having my body, it's like my home. But then at the same time I hate it here. Daily conversations are robotic and empty. People are rude and selfish. Everyone is obsessed with fast cars and big houses and parties... but none of it means anything. I'm just so tired. I want to run away and build my own hut in the forest.;no
depression. not sadness which is caused by something and is healthy. Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time.;no
If it's anything like here in New York, walk into an emergency room and tell them you're there because you want to kill your self. That's probably the easiest fastest way, since you'll probably have to wait to talk to your doctor.;no
Your mom sounds verbally abusive. I'm sorry you feel like this. I hope things get better for you soon.;strong
How can I miss someone I never had?;no
so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.;strong
I'm glad it worked for you. I've been going for a few weeks and so far it hasnt helped, so good that it helps some people;strong
Why not? Are depressed people not supposed to feel a little hope at times?;no
I know what you mean, I've put off going to the doctors for about a year so far partly because of this... I think it's healthier to contextualise it like this: Is my emotional state effecting my quality of life? Do I constantly put myself down and have low confidence? Comparing yourself to others is a race to the bottom, somebody is always 'worse' off in your eyes because you dont value yourself as much as you do other people, your mind down plays your own successes and overplays others. The hard bit is convincing yourself that is the case, fuck even I'm not convinced and I have some self awareness of why I feel the way I do, it's hard man. Your feelings are real and you dont need to prove otherwise to anybody but yourself.;weak
What makes you feel like this?;no
Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.;no
Just do your best man. going through dark times (probably the worst of my entire life), just keep trucking on.;weak
*hug* Whatever the situation is that's causing you to feel this way, please remember to exercise compassion towards yourself.;strong
It's always sunny above the clouds;no

Sorry for your loss, but don't feel guilty, there's probably a reason why you feel that way. Also, your feelings might clear with time.;strong
Sorry to hear that, feel free to PM if you want to.;strong
Yup, everything is an ordeal.;no
Trust me I am done with it too and you dont suffer alone bro so find comfort in that;weak
Same, I sit in my room and play Zelda games, writing/reading fanfics, and playing instruments. I hope you feel better soon bud;weak
you just happen to be. get as much joy as you can.;no
I didn't talk for a year and a half when I was small. I couldn't talk as I was threatened if I did then very bad things would happen. I remember it very well. It was so difficult. I'm sorry you are feeling the way you are now. I'm here if you want to talk. Please take care.;strong
I sleep, a lot. It actually takes practice to sleep a lot, the trick is to try your best not to wake up. You want to sleep long hours in one sitting, otherwise you will have problem falling asleep. Nothing is better than sleep. Sometimes I dream, and regardless what I dream it's always better than reality.;no
sorry you feel this way. I do too. It provides a release.;strong
Try it. It feels like;no
This post made me smile because of the grim feel, but then I felt super sorry and sad because I can relate too well..;weak
"Trust me, don't do it. I have a scar on my left arm where I cut really deep and it gives me anxiety from people seeing it and depresses my mood looking at it.

Congratulations! Paycheck incoming. Netflix account incoming. Porn subscri- No?;strong
My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this.;no
I'm very sorry that happened to you - I know the pain of loving someone and not having them love you back - How long have you back feeling depressed for?;strong
I just want to go back to sleep but I because all been doing is sleeping. a nice escape I guess;no
I'd say that they choose to endure it... It's just that they have a more hopeful insight, they can fully understand something good will happen from their work, and they can grasp that it's real. That's why I sometimes wonder if Depression is stunted cognition (maybe imagination), because if I could imagine the beauty that life has to offer I'm sure that no matter what got in my way I'd plow through. Why would neurotypicals work so hard if they couldn't in some way see the other side, feel it, almost experiencing it? I just think we're unable to do that.;no
What have you been failing at?;no
I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better.;strong
Get some full spectrum LEDs bulbs. Works great;no
How many milligrams are each tablet and how much do you weigh? If you're looking to kill yourself, clonidine can't kill you. Just put you in a coma. Which will only make the suffering worse. Please do not attempt suicide using anything. It's Christmas, man. You can reply to this if you need to vent or anything, I'm here for you dude. Again. Don't attempt suicide. Please. For me. A stranger on the internet who cares more than you think.;weak
Hmu if you want to talk.;weak
That's hard. Especially if you're the type of person to post in this sub. Loving yourself is really difficult. But loving others is easier. And I do love you. When you love others, I find, its easier to love yourself. Even just saying the words and seeing it echoed back makes me feel good. I hope I helped.;strong
You don't overcome it. You learn to live with it. Its who you are and there's nothing wrong with that. I find thrill seeking helps me. I'm sure it's not the most productive strategy, but it definately gets me to keep waking up. If you ever need to talk, feel free to message me.;weak
Talk about it to a therapist or ANYONE. talking about it helps tremendously. Call a suicide hotline if you have no one to talk to. You would be surprised how much just talking about your issues helps.;no
Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe. I went out of it over two and a half years, and I hadn't ever known about these kinds of things until I was 19. Just trying to say it can be done man. Love you;strong
You are loved and you can get through this.;weak
Thats pretty awesome dude smiling is fun.;strong
Well, it's great that you have the self-awareness to realize this. Now you can start to turn that around, day by day.;weak
Wait, you got fired due your depression? Where are you from? Isn't depression classified as a medical condition like any other? Aren't you protected by law against such action? Sorry to read about your situation. And sorry for all the questions. Guilty of being a lawyer :/;strong
"I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not";weak
Oh, my family does that all the time. Like, what do you expect. Also, when they say they're feeling worse than I am for having to watch me depressed. Like, hello, I'm depressed here, not you. And when they try to blane it all on my anxiety and my negativity, like I'm to blame people generally don't like me.;no
I'm sorry. I've been in and out of a relationship for years now. She's loving and considerate and great in so many ways.. but there's no commitment. Actually the space between us has grown over the years. I guess part of it is that I'm a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing. I don't even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life. But at the end of the day I just want to go home and share my life with her.. and she's not there. She's done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line. Like I'm just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer, I'm just too screwed up for it to work. I feel so lonely and so stupid for everything I've done to turn her away.;strong
Good, keep it up. I'm glad someone could get help, being around people in similar situations has certainly made me feel at least a little better.;weak
I'm sorry you have to deal with that toxic kind of person. If I may ask I imagine you still live with her and have to deal with this kind of garbage pretty often?;strong
*hug* Whatever the situation is that's causing you to feel this way, please remember to exercise compassion towards yourself.;strong
Expecting people to stop being depressed like turning off a light is extremely stupid.;no
not really, people just say it does, as they want you to stay alive because theyre selfish;no
I bought my self kfc, no one is doing anything, or i should say i was invited to nothing. Im sorry to hear that im sure she loves you or why else would you still be living with her. if you just went over to visit im unsure why youd put your self threw that.;strong
Good morning bro, im happy that you woke up and read this comment! I hope you have a great day today!;strong

Am I to endure this for the rest of my life?;strong
I'm really sorry for this. I'm going through something similar and I have pretty much given up all hope that I am the same as my peers. I am definitely not. I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill. After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time.;strong
What have you tried in order to combat depression?;no
really sorry going through this. basically going through the same thing right now. Let me know if you ever wanna chat. Things will get better eventually, I hope.;strong

I know how frustrating this is. My dr diagnosed me with a really difficult to treat depression. once a medicine starts working I immediately i start feeling more awful than ever. I'm trying to get my life together. I got a kitten to keep me company and after months of job searching I got hired at a cool place (I start in a week). But i'm having worse nightmares than ever, and I just can't be as excited as i think I should be. Its hard :(;weak

Dam you're lucky. Have you thought about maybe volunteering, working in nature and meeting positive people perhaps? And meditate, many people your age and situation start to look into meditation for long-lasting happiness. It's the perfect time. Do you have any possessions? Sell it, you may find that you will be better off without them = ) Feel free to chat to me if you want. You don't have to look at this as a dead-end, but a start to a beautiful journey. I don't post in r/depression, well because it says to Do not post or respond with: it gets better messages. How does that make you feel? I find that ridiculous lol. I hope you find what makes your life worth living. The truth is, whoever you are, wherever you are.. Life *does* get better, more than you can imagine.;weak
It's easier for us to think well be dead than face how painful the future might be;no
Force yourself to take a shower in the morning. Then force yourself to get dressed and take a walk. No end goal in mind. Just a nice leisurely walk. what I did abroad and I found myself in the most fantastic places.;no
I used to feel like that, pretty sure I have a post from a few months almost exactly the same. But it does get better friend. You can overcome those feelings, it takes effort but it is possible. Hope you get better soon;weak
I feel the same way, I am single and have problems socially. So being alone makes my motivation worse and makes me really depressed. I am failing most of my classes this semester and don't seem to have motivation to make a rebound. Just know that theres people out there going through what your going through and I am here to at least give you assurance that you aren't alone in situations like this. I don't like it when people tend to say just force yourself to be motivated, but I am just lazy and hopeless at this point. I wish the best for you and I actually was on pill medication for this sort of stuff at a point, so if you got questions about that or anything in general maybe I can make use of myself and help someone out who needs it more than I do.;weak
The capacity for love can't be built in isolation.;no
**hugs if you want them**;strong
You're not alone. I feel the same way.;no
I get it. I had the worst Christmas to date..,.and I just was kind of just on autopilot. Things that normally evoke at least some sadness or happiness or anger or anxiety, even bother me. I felt nothing. like disappearing. No one checks on me. No calls from family, no texts from been days. Everything just seems gray. even the point anymore?;no
Man she don't know what she's saying then! I had/still kinda have it. There are different levels so I don't know where about's you are but it only gets better if you let it. Try going into a senses deprivation tank if you have one in your town. Trust me. Meditate. Look at yourself and why you think this is. You'll figure it out :);weak
Chill man high school isn't that bad all you have to do is just be chill and if you don't want to talk to anyone that's fine but eventually someone will want to talk to you that's just how it is :);strong
"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them. This action means that they are a cheater, not that you are worthless.";strong
happy birthday! hope you have a chance to celebrate yourself;weak
I'm sorry. You have no one to talk to?;strong
Yah professionals don't give a fuck. Pisses me off when someone says 'go see a therapist' -- no bitch I need some love because I'm broken from an abusive past, bullying, and that the fact is no one wants to do or associate anything with me if I reveal my true self... Are you gonna take the Prozac?;no
Elaborate my friend. We're here to help.;weak
Do you have anyone you can call?;no
My dad was depressed. He had a lot of mood swings, which were difficult to deal with as a kid. And made me feel very worthless;no
Thought I should write something since the posts you were getting didn't look helpful. It is hard not to kick yourself when you feel that you never took a chance to be with someone you thought was the one, especially when you consider them to be such a great person. I mean, how can people not blame it all oneself if the other person is what we see as nothing but good? It is points in our life like these that we carry with us that tend to weigh us down in life, these moments of regret that can build up over time that we can't move forward.;no
Hey, what grade are you in? 29 and I have felt that way many many times especially when I was going through school. Negativity is temporary I promise you. Honestly high school is just a blip on the radar for you I swear. It feel like it now but damn are you going to feel good when you persevere. And you will persevere I promise you, I promise you that you can do it. If you need someone to talk to feel free to message me if you are comfortable. I grew up in a dirty and chaotic home with cat shit behind the couches and the TV and everything smelled bad,all the clothes smelled like mildew and my parents were upset and angry all the time and there were drugs involved and I was overweight and nobody was helping and yada yada yada and I just want you to know that no matter how bad it gets, you build a unique strength that no one else can even touch upon just by making it day by day. Your experience, is one that I understand I promise you and you are going to come out of this a bad ass. I promise you can do it;weak
That is the question we all ask ourselves. But if you feel that you hit rock bottom, it can only go up from there.;weak
I think accepting that you are YOU rather than that you are ugly could help. Because you ARE you. You're no one else, and you never will be. You have one body, and no matter how you feel about it, it's all you have. You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours. I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding. They don't belong in my head. I don't have to listen to them. They can be there, but they don't have to mean anything to me. I'm stronger than they are. I know the truth. They're just trying to confuse me. That sort of thing. The more you can view them as a separate entity from yourself, the easier it gets, in my opinion.;no
I try to remind myself everyone's life is a tragedy, not only mine. Although this world is cursed, it really does have some beautiful people who only want to help. Keep looking, you'll find them eventually OP.;weak
Dude. This feeling, I know it, and sadly, this is a common go-to response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute. It's out of context and beside the point in essence. It's a variation of the ever popular At least you aren't a starving kid in [insert country here]! and more generally It could be worse! Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point? It's invalidating, insensitive and snobby, at best, and I have no idea if it helps you feel any better, but when a lot of people say it, they do think they're doing some genuine good to help you feel better, despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is. My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said. In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it.;strong
Wow, that's cool! ^(*I'm an experimental bot. I can make mistakes.*);no
You should, but in this society you don't.;no
Heya buddy, i can relate, After 18 years of struggling I finally found out I have dyslexia, fine motor control issues and short term memory loss. It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics. I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing. When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them. Don't worry about other people, they will become dust while you will become a diamond. My question to you is, how are you going to move forward?;weak
What's been hurting you lately? I know birthdays can be awful when depressed, as I've had my fair share.;weak
That sucks, but believe me, self medicating only makes things worse.;weak
It's good that you are spending quality time with your grandma. Our grandparents are only with us for so long.;weak
If I recognise a flaw in myself, it's bad enough to be noticeable by others. That's not an overestimation, that's a fact. not gonna lie tho, I never considered plastic surgery, hahaa. it just seems...strange.;no

Don't worry friend, rant all you want if it helps. I'm here for you.;weak
I'm sorry that haopened. I've never had a breakup because I always get rejected. I've had similar things so I can at least get an idea of how that must feel. But I believe you can find another girl you live.;strong
We may need to hear the content of the conversation. Just saying something like was seem very convincing. Perhaps think I should try antidepressants like to see a Dr for my depression and see if benefit from;no
Remember that eventually you won't cry, and that you woke up today to experience another day of life. Maybe it wasn't the best day, but tomorrow is a brand new one, and it's going to be ok, whether I'm talking about tomorrow or in an hour or a week, it will be ok. I'm really sorry you are feeling down.;strong
8 years of very severe, suicidal depression, I feel you, mate. I'm incredibly sorry.;strong
My word of advice is just, be careful. If you genuinely feel like you can make it work again, then go for it, but if there's that doubt or feeling that you're going to get hurt again, it might be best to step away. Sometimes you can get back with an ex and it all goes well, but when it doesn't they can get in your head lay their eggs and just dominate every moment of thought. Look at your options and determine what the best result will be for yourself;no
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?;strong
Having been abandoned by close family when I was young, I guess become preconditioned to expect people to eventually always do the same. It hurts because it means I can never truly get close to people, or if I do I get too clingy making sure they never leave me. a vicious cycle.;no
I get how you feel. I constantly scroll though my social media feeds and realise how much of a loner I really am. Seeing everybody out partying and enjoying their great life and then me at home all alone and not one person to talk to. :(;weak
I feel the same. I'm sorry.;strong
Every day since she left me. I wake up disappointed I didn't die in my sleep. Sorry you are the same. Fingers crossed for some better luck tonight.;weak
I agree. Last week I had a day where I was so happy and everything was fine. Then one thing didn't go the way I wanted it to and I was crying at work within the next hour... hate feeling like that too.;weak
Oh shit man please fucking don't. Firstly death by acid is more painful than having your DNA ripped apart by radiation. Secondly, explain your life situation to me and we can talk, I'm here for you;strong
Everything is pointless, all our feelings are illusions because they are all brain chemicals. I don't see any meaning in life, there is no purpose, no happiness, no satisfaction. Why being happy/wanting to live is the normal quality of a human? Can't depressed be normal too? Is depression real?;no
I hope you're okay. There's always reason to fight even when it feels like there's nothing.;weak
you can't win this game ! damnet.;no
I don't really have anything to say besides that I understand your pain. Stay strong.;weak
Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it goes by quick.;strong
Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?;strong

I'm really sorry for this. I'm going through something similar and I have pretty much given up all hope that I am the same as my peers. I am definitely not. I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill. After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time.;strong
i totally get that shit. seriously i do. i was just asking, i was just wondering. maybe your one of the lucky ones meant to wait for their real love to come. giving my situation id of totally preferred that, then being torn apart with bad relationships causing all sorts of insecurities. being lonely sucks, but being broken any better.. be;weak
I hear you. So well. And I'm so sorry you feel that way. I left my difficult-to-get-into art school because of this (and my classmates treated it like high school and were jerks, but thats irrelevant). It's not easy.;strong
If you were here I would hug you right now.;strong
Quote I've always hung hard into everything will be ok in the end, if it's not okay, it's not the end I understand that is a very hard thing to believe. I went out of it over two and a half years, and I hadn't ever known about these kinds of things until I was 19. Just trying to say it can be done man. Love you;strong
I want to let so much out.;no
I'm sorry. That's horrible... Are things getting better there, at least?;strong
Parents pass on their coping skills to their kids. If they have unhealthy ways of dealing with life, it's pretty likely their kids will have issues in that area too. This can be passed down from grandparents even. Also there is likely a genetic factor. But in my POV, I think it has to do with upbringing moreso.;no
Right now, I just fucked everything up;no
Spend some time just to meditate and clear out your mind. Take a walk around town. Maybe go buy a coffee, something to distract yourself before you attempt the 'writing assignment'. Just start simple. It doesn't have to be in paragraph form or even complete sentences. Maybe bullet points will make it easier.;no
happy birthday. i still feel birthdays are worth celebrating by ourselves.;no
hell yes thats a win! Keep fighting and try running some laps. It'll make you feel great!;weak
Sorry to hear. I hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again.;strong
I completely understand what you mean. Every day is a fight. Just getting through. Waiting for... something. Nothing. I get it. Luckily, I only feel like this part of the time. Good luck, friend. Keep putting one foot in front of the other and pushing through. Maybe some day, whatever we're waiting for and trying to get to will actually happen and it won't be a struggle anymore.;weak
Do you see a therapist ? Maybe a medical treatment with a psychiatrist and regular appointments could help you ? I have been doing it it and it has been helping me;no

"Why the heck do we hate ourselves?! Man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell. Nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else. Sorry to get weird there, it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves. Anyway, I have one scar on my arm from one time that I tried that and there forever. It still makes me sad when I see it. so sorry for what pain you are in. There will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself &amp; the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face.";strong
Hope that things will get better.;no
I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better.;strong
sadness is not the same as depression. And people trip all the time and others laugh, it's no big deal and no one cares beyond that moment. Next time, either make a comment about your legs not working, or bow to everyone, or something like that, or just get on the bus and keep going with your day. Imagine if you were a waiter and dropped some glasses- would you walk right out of the restaurant because people clapped?;weak
There must be a reason you're posting in this thread, there are lots of wonderful people going through this who would offer their support. I'm sorry you're going through such a hard time, and I hope you can find some hope to carry on. I don't know how much words on a screen from an online stranger would help, but if you need a reason to stay alive, let this comment be one. Take care!;strong
sorry you feel this way. I do too. It provides a release.;strong
sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?;strong
Please don't cut yourself. You can post more about your situation, I'm sure there are always people in this sub that will offer a listening ear. I would.;weak
Wait, you got fired due your depression? Where are you from? Isn't depression classified as a medical condition like any other? Aren't you protected by law against such action? Sorry to read about your situation. And sorry for all the questions. Guilty of being a lawyer :/;strong
"Dude, you can't say that. If there's really really one who's gonna miss you, think about your parents and family. I get this idea from time to time, but just when I think my mom &amp; dad, it actually make me feel better. Stay positive buddy. Good luck :)";weak
My dear, sometimes you've gotta learn to comfort yourself. I had to recently. All I wanted was someone to just be there and tell me everything is going to be ok. The one person I needed to tell me this, never came. You have to be your own hero. You are a strong human.;weak
I'll be honest, I feel kinda sorry for you. You have completely nobody? Perhaps you had some people, but due to some things those relationships didn't work out?;strong
Every victory is well deserved :);no
I've felt like this before. My advice would be to set a goal even something small or stupid. I have a goal to get better at singing. It's hard but at a the same time it gives me motivation otherwise I'm lacking deeply;no
I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain.;strong
I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful;strong
I feel you. I feel life is too much and I rather die because my anxiety makes me feel it's not worth to be alive. But then again I want to live because I'm terrified of death. I just hate that fucking feeling, man. You are not alone in this tho.;weak
Please Feelings can lie to us...perhaps time to fuel up with new thoughts?? You can do it!!;weak
That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!;weak
There's no better person to tell someone something than a nurturing mother. They typically love you unconditionally. Friends and significant others get a scent of the depression on you and they distance themselves as it becomes a deeper problem as opposed to helping. If your mother loves you, she will understand.. And it's not like you are admitting you have gay sex or addictions to banging drugs up your arm or killed someone... This is (not to be insensitive) remotely benign to say to your family.. They might be able to recommend something that helps..;weak
I know how it feels man. It sucks. terrible to hear and sorry :(;weak
omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo). Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant.;strong
Hey, sorry that you had to deal with that. Those dreams that you discern from reality are the worst... is this something that you frequently deal with?;strong
Holy shit I can relate so well to this.;strong
That someone will come into your life when you least expect it. I want to kill your hopes by saying that they cure your depression, because they very well could, but they also may not. I will say, that having someone you love and someone who loves you does help. But remember that you have to put so much effort into looking for someone because the right person will show up without you having to try so hard. beat yourself up if you have anyone yet, it takes time of course. Focus on yourself and doing things that you enjoy, things that help pull you away from depressive thoughts. get through this;no
Yea I need to remember how to do this but I agree;no
Hi there. No one on this earth is worthless, even if you feel that way now. It gets better, things change, you will change. I browsed through your post history and noticed how young you are. The age you're in is a horrible hormonic stage. My son had the same feelings at that age-range. I did too. Even if life feels overwhelming and lonely now, this will pass eventually. Be patient. I have to go for a while, but will get back to you with how my son learned to cope. Hang in there. A big motherly hug to you!;strong
Tbh. I used to hate being sensitive. But I love it now. And people need to be considerate of it! really a strength. Being sensitive makes your more empathetic (which is an amazing fucking quality to have!) and just really more in tune with the mood of the room. Do you know there are some people that just babble on and even ever tell that other stopped listening?? I know it sucks overthinking and constantly worrying. But being sensitive makes you a better human.;no
I'm sorry to hear that. If you are able to you could channel that sadness into a drawing or poem or something like that. It might help a little.;strong
Hey buddy you are not alone. I spent a day where I literally didn't so much as sit up in bed a couple of weeks ago. Didn't eat or drink anything so I didn't need the bathroom which was good. I'm not at a point where I have any advice to give or anything but maybe you can find some comfort knowing that other people feel the same as you.;weak
Chemicals in our brains are weird;no
I feel the same and i think its because i have nobody to talk to, nobody to be vulnerable to and let them know how i feel inside. Why dont you try to talk to your girlfriend, i bet if she'd new she'd try to help. Open up to her! Hope it goes well :);weak
Oh shit man please fucking don't. Firstly death by acid is more painful than having your DNA ripped apart by radiation. Secondly, explain your life situation to me and we can talk, I'm here for you;strong
Yeah. The numbness is hard to get used to, it sucks. Sometimes it can be better than a roller coaster though.;weak
Ah I'm sorry :( Panic attack are awful but you certainly shouldn't feel embarrassed!;strong
I'm in the same boat. Actually just took way too many pills and hope i don't wake up. If I do then I guess it's not my time. Keep your head up. Its not worth it.;weak
you are not, stay positive, look ahead;weak
I'm around if you need someone to chat with. I'm sorry you're feeling sad. Sometimes it's such a painful and unbearable feeling.;strong
Can you talk about whats going on in your head? Maybe if you get it out, it will be a little more sorted? I'm sorry it's so overwhelming right now. Someone loves you, they just don't know how to show it the right way, right now.;strong
hope you all the best in your journey;weak
To me it feels not genuous most of the time, but also you don't respect their opinion on it. Say, a really unfunny person telling you that you're funno doesnt mean anything.;no
If there's one thing I regret not doing, it's that I didn't kill myself when I was 12 and actually attempted it. It's been all downhill in the 15 years since.;no
In truth, they may not know how to help. They think they by offering encouraging words they're being helpful. Sometimes they need to be made aware if what kind of help you need and sometimes realizing help from a.professiknal may be more beneficial.;no
Hang in there. Spontaneous Remission blesses like an angel. When she comes, there will be new people you love and love you in return. Stick it out. You got this.;weak

No friends here, willing to listen. Need someone to listen to me sometime too. I'm going to bed right now, but if you want to message me I will get back to you tomorrow.;weak
I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been dealing with depression? Life is indeed very messy and hard. I'd hang out with you and buy you a drink and listen to your story if I could.;strong
No, depression isn't a choice. You can't control it.;weak
If you are not happy and you are not ill then you need to do different things.;no
Make the most of the upswing :);no
Just to say I was totally in that place at the start of last week when I went on holiday. Had a massive cry and a big old panic and then made it all worse by beating myself up with it/being all like SHOULD BE HAPPY, WHY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY. I AM ANGRY THAT I AM NOT angry just makes more sad and a nasty cycle. Know that allowed to feel how you feel, and okay to go on holiday and feel like crap. I hope things start to feel a bit better and you get some relaxing in.;weak
I feel you. I can't pretend anymore. I was working in a hipster place. Yunno, a cool, open work space where everybody wants to work. But all the sounds, the loud talking, the meaningless conversations. It's not me. I can't stand trying to be happy all the time. I just want to hide, but it's a freaking open space. I don't like to see people all the time.;weak
god damn i honestly feel the exact same as you in every aspect. sometimes i also just sit back and think about how none of this feels real, then the suicidal thoughts come on because i feel like there has to be more, then more sad, more depersonalized, and its just a vicious cycle. nothing matters, but we should at least live to the fullest, because in relative terms it matters. no idea how to do that though;weak
I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help. *-hugs-*;strong
I don't think that's weird at all. Just don't forget that you're still the same person you were before you changed how you think of yourself.;weak
Late at night is pretty much the only time I feel normal. Too bad I waste most of the night on sleep.;no
Hang in there. It'll be better, I promise.;weak
I get it. I got out of my bed, picked up my books (to study), my pc, but then just went to another bed I have at home. :/;weak
I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. A person can be cared for by dozens and still feel alone, depression is a monster. I hope you're able to make progress against it in your own way, or by talking to people you trust, living the life you want to live, or by obtaining professional help. Please send me a message if you would like to talk to someone privately.;strong
*hug* Whatever the situation is that's causing you to feel this way, please remember to exercise compassion towards yourself.;strong
Hopefully he's a nice guy and doesn't punch you;weak
Happy Birthday. I'm sorry your birthday is going less well than you hoped. I had kind of a rough start in high school too so I know how you feel better than most. I'm open to talk whenever you like.;strong
You could look forward to getting better. Slowly, and maybe never fully cured, but better. It's a good thing to aim for, unattainable as it seems.;no
"You don't. All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me. I plan to become a traveling hermit and live in the wild with a tent or tarp. I consider myself a successful human being because I've cultivated my mind. I've figured things out. I've matured enough to manage my own personality (as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people). Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them). If it makes logical sense that you don't need to be successful in their bullshit sense, go with that, regardless of whether people will back it up. Logic over worthless people's worthless validation.";no
Wish I could do this but unfortunately I'd get assaulted.;no
Woah... that's accurate. The posts in this sub today really reflect me. This is very truthful, I just live with it;strong
in that case i'm a cold mess.;no
I don't want to keep waking up at 1 am it's hard;no
I feel you there and I am so sorry! Those people suck!;strong
I'm sorry. You have no one to talk to?;strong
Thirty-three but no kids. It's honestly a struggle being around my nieces and nephew when I'm not doing well so I give you credit.;no
It's the last thing I'll do. But I have too much to do first.;no

You are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and I think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings, im sorry i couldn't help more and hope you get better;strong
Only you can answer the question. I personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life. Though I agree that the hamster wheel and rat-race pretty sucks, but I just don't see much alternative at this point if I want to keep doing what I do now...;weak
I feel you. I can't pretend anymore. I was working in a hipster place. Yunno, a cool, open work space where everybody wants to work. But all the sounds, the loud talking, the meaningless conversations. It's not me. I can't stand trying to be happy all the time. I just want to hide, but it's a freaking open space. I don't like to see people all the time.;weak
This is why communities like this are amazing. We're all at our lowest, and sometimes our worst. We can't judge in the end, at least, I can say so for myself. I feel your pain. Always wanting to be alone with my pain but having it magnified for it. It cuts in a way no knife can reach. I know anytime you post here everyone jumps in with this, but though I suck at human contact my inbox is open if you just want to chat. I'm painfully lonely at times too, and bare minimum we can relate to that.;weak
I did. The nightmares were so bad I had to stop taking it because I couldn't sleep. A few days after stopping I was able to sleep much better. Unfortunately I'm not sure what you can do to avoid stopping the meds.;no
Hi there. No one on this earth is worthless, even if you feel that way now. It gets better, things change, you will change. I browsed through your post history and noticed how young you are. The age you're in is a horrible hormonic stage. My son had the same feelings at that age-range. I did too. Even if life feels overwhelming and lonely now, this will pass eventually. Be patient. I have to go for a while, but will get back to you with how my son learned to cope. Hang in there. A big motherly hug to you!;strong
"Helping someone else is often an achievement. - Even if we don't actually help them, we go to the effort to actually do something, with effort, thought, compassion and eagerness to do good. - When everything is hard to do, because C R I P P P I N G D E P R E S S I O N, let us count very victory no matter how small it may feel. Achievements help us to feel a little less shitty - we did a thing! Yay But also when we help others we help ourselves. - We remind ourselves to be positive, we read commends and upboat new ideas, where we may even add them to our own ideology. - To learn about the struggles of others we feel indifferent which is comforting - maybe we arnt as weird and broken as we tell ourselves? TL:DR; I'm rambling because I'm bored and high. Shoot me. Please, ty Also indifferent is the opposite of different right lol tbqh rn fam cbf googling soz yolo";no
take a nap with you if it meant never wake up. Do you believe there is a point to living besides to die?? Perhaps you could dream about that? A new life, a better life. Where there is a clear purpose.;weak
I am sorry feeling this way, I have been where you are and I know how much it sucks. Please give up!;strong
Exercise has always helped when I am as you said. If you would do anything to feel better, then muster everything you have for high intensity exercise. At least 45 minutes for three time per week. I get it, the last thing you want to do is exercise, but if you will do anything to get out of it, just do it.;weak
I'm drowning too. Everyday. It easy to take shit for granted. I never thought my life would get worse. I thought I was invincible but life fucks you up in so many ways. You need to find some inspirational music and listen to it a lot. Maybe make a goal for something. I know it all seems futile but little things sometimes help. But I know how hard it can be. When you're caught under those dark deep waves. Surrounded by onlookers on their cruise. It's easy to say fuck it but you deserve to be happy.. I hope u can find something that helps you through this darkness.;weak
Hey, sorry that you had to deal with that. Those dreams that you discern from reality are the worst... is this something that you frequently deal with?;strong
sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :);strong
I feel this way too. It's like we've been branded so we can never forget we belong to despair.;no
Aww you are so lucky to have her by your side..! Inspirational;strong
I'm sorry you feel this way. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?;strong
I think I probably spend too much time thinking about sex and stuff and it would probably be better if I didn't. Though I don't think I could enjoy it due to the ever present risk of STI's and unwanted pregnancies and even vasectomies don't technically 100% alleviate that risk. I don't think it would be really all as great as it gets built up in my mind to be. I think the biggest thing is the difficulty building up and sustaining interest in things to distract myself with. I have things I like, at least theoretically, but I never feel much like persuing them. It all seems kind of meaningless and stupid and pointless. I'm not sure how to get over that hurdle.;no
I take melatonin and that works;no
Remember to let them out of the cage every now and then, don't hold them in there 24/7;no
Sorry for your loss, but don't feel guilty, there's probably a reason why you feel that way. Also, your feelings might clear with time.;strong
I'm so sorry. Are u ok;strong
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! (is doing *weird* things with my formatting.)  It's your birthday. You can be any way you want. You can want people to make a big deal even if you are depressed and want to not let them at the same time. You day, your rules. Happy happy 19:);strong
I guess that depends on your country and social security system... But a phonebook will probably Work! :);no
What do you enjoy doing in your free time. Sitting around being depressed doesn't make for good story-telling. At least it didnt for me. Also, please don't apologize. We absolutely want to hear how you're feeling on this sub and it's beneficial to see and hear other people's perspectives going through this hell.;weak
Check in with us! I hope we shed some light for you in there. Hugs.;strong
I wish the same. A simple, pain-free way out.;no
This is known as SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder, or something like that. And yeah a bulb and natural lighting help out a lot;weak
Thats totally normal, most people get that from time to time. It will pass, the when is the real question. Good news is you can work on the when, at least it works for me. I think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling, not fight it and not try to change it, even try to get yourself to cry. The point is really to change your mindset from 'i have depression i can't cure it, it is killing me' to 'i'm sad again for no reason, human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell, I'm gonny cry all day to give it what it wants'..;weak
Because you are important! Your life matters! You shall find someone who will be understanding and there for you when you are depressed. You just need to let yourself be vulnerable and keep dating until you find the right person. It may take awhile but it's worth the wait. For you and that future person.;weak
Trying to study, understand, and accept yourself -- relatable music, expressive activities, which invoke you out from within, out of your own being, and into any form of materialized form to see/hear clearly. Et cetera. Basically spending time with your own self on deeper levels, as difficult and sometimes even saddening that may be and feel so.;no
I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain.;strong
Was that supposed to be funny, because that was pretty funny.;no
"I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not";weak
Sorry to hear that man. What are you studying? Do you feel like the material you are studying is hard, or is the volume of the work too much?;strong
It's all about tiny victories!!! Keep going my friend :);weak
I am sorry I'm alive;strong
glad you found something to help even if just a little;weak
When you're alone do you find that you can be content while also taking care of yourself or do you start to feel like you're slipping and increasingly become overwhelmed and unable to do daily things to take care of yourself? Sometimes it can be hard to understand what's going on inside and it helps to watch what you start doing/stop doing instead.;no
Why even care what random people think of you? likely go crazy worrying about that stuff;no
Once you are at the bottom you can only go up. Hope things get better for you :);weak
Join the club... On a more serious note, killing yourself would be really selfish. There are people out there that care about u whether u see it or not. It's not all about u.;weak

i don't know what to do i am feeling suicidal right now .;no
I don't hate you.  Wait. Are you responsible for the stairs that just aren't quite right? That's on my list of things that I hate.;weak
There is nothing more rewarding than seeing actual results! Congratulations on having a clean bedroom and bathroom. Don't forget that cleaning it the first time after a period of neglect is always the most work. If you continue to keep those places tidy, it will be much easier and quicker the second time around.;weak
As long as you arent overdosing there is no reason to get rid of them. Keep them for a rainy day, or if things get consistently worse;no
I would totally cry at my desk, no one even noticed.;no
Being alone is difficult. Honestly it helps to reach out. I reconnected with an old friend. We hadn't been in touch for couple years over a petty argument and a bad experience being roommates. Anyone in your life you could reach out to?;weak
I'm sorry. This is true for me as well. And they regularly remind me. I think we can get through it though. Actually, that's a lie. I hope you can get through it. I'm not going to be able too.....;strong
Try finding new hobbies. This will help your mental state stay focused on something else. Also just try going out and engaging with other people. This always helps me since social interaction is really good for mental health.;no
It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time.;weak
Hey its okay man. Life sucks dick, just keep pushing through.;weak
Check in with us! I hope we shed some light for you in there. Hugs.;strong
