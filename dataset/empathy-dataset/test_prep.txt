been there but can i give a really cool trick that might truly help when looking for a job try to find a new storerestaurantplace opening up no matter what it is it was my trick back into the work force because when a place is just opening everyone is new and everyone is learning so all in it together instead of walking into an established place where people already know what doing and have friends etc anyway what worked for me in the end either way keep trying taking it one step at a time fill out applications and if you get phone calls set up interviews if you get too anxious and go then go but maybe one day have that little extra burst of energy and go and if you start working and like it ok you can look elsewhere so just keep pushing along;weak

well if you looked at how those people spend their time it would probably be very different than how you spend your time so it kind of makes sense that they would have different results and resulting feelings about their life since their life is so different but the good news is you can have a happy fuller life too what you should do is list out the top five things you dont like about your life then you should spend some time working on the one that is bothering you the most in my experience when i was unhappy with my life it was because i was neglecting some part of my life that was really nagging me rooting for you hope this helps;weak

dude this feeling i know it and sadly this is a common goto response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute its out of context and beside the point in essence its a variation of the ever popular at least you arent a starving kid in insert country here and more generally it could be worse like yes thanks very much captain obvious everything is relative but thats beside the point its invalidating insensitive and snobby at best and i have no idea if it helps you feel any better but when a lot of people say it they do think theyre doing some genuine good to help you feel better despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is my boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after years of explaining why this is not a good response hes slowly using it less but when it pops up my typical counter is that does not help memake me feel better at all and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said in any case im sorry you had that shitty nonreason response thrown at you what youre going through is real and valid even if others choose not to acknowledge it;strong
i dont think thats weird at all just dont forget that youre still the same person you were before you changed how you think of yourself;weak
you forgot you still have yourself youre not worthless just because you dont have any money dont stay for your brothers stay for yourself this sounds but there is stuff worth staying for the shitty truth is if we kill ourselves people mourn for a day then move on and forget us our life briefly becomes a public spectacle people spout shit like ohh what a sweet person shame they died they wont say that they were the ones who ignored us when we were alive and suffering they will forget you so stay the fuck alive and make them notice you because you deserve to be noticed worthlessness usually stems from lack of accomplishment if that applies to you start learning or doing something anything that interests you just give it your all but dont die just yet you will eventually so why hurry so for now look in the mirror every time you feel youre alone and remind yourself youre not;weak
im always focused on myself even when people are talking to me im too focused on how they are actually perceiving me than listening to then;no

depression isnt something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it a lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it and its hard to tell what path is right or wrong talking to people does help but you need to find someone you can talk to i couldnt talk to my mom for the life of me my sister would tell my mom or tell me i was wrong my dad just gave me a look and didnt know what to say besides he cares about me once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me she listened and didnt judge she let me talk and told didnt lecture but reassured my decisions she went out of her way to make me feel more confident thats the person you need to find also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind write it in chicken scratch dont worry about how ty write just write what you feel then throw the paper away that used to help me not as much as my mom did but i did help life isnt something we can live alone although a lot of us want to i wish i could find someone to confide in that supports you;no

ive definatley been there but if ive learned anything through my depression deployments college and life in general is that it always gets worse before it start s to get better and i know how cliche that might sound but i can vouch for it life isnt going to be easy whoever says it is is fucking lying life is about perception mentality over reality you are strong enough to survive you can make it but you have to believe in yourself dont let people or work or circumstance dictate you only let yourself dictate who you are you can do this;weak

people are being exposed to the harsh reality of life earlier thanks to the availability and ease of access of information;no
im so sorry are u ok;strong
i would love to hug you irl _ hugs;weak
the good is worth it hang in there you can get through this because youre stronger than this you can make it through cause the good will be worth it lots of love;weak
dear anna_rampage thank you for your kind words im just a regular lonely nobody but it means the world for me to hear that that someone really cares thank you so much  it brighten my day;strong
my advice dont fall in love with any one losing love is the worst feeling i the world just dont do it stop now while you can you are better off alone;no
if pushing you to do it yeah file a complaint if they know suicidal and just their mindset i see you benefiting from it at all assuming in the usa;no
yea things go more wrong when happy kind of really i just get more nervous because i suddenly have that happiness to lose when im depressed it is what it is but when like carrying a bag of money through a bad neighbourhood at let me lose lol i be happy if not risking something the risk and fear of losing the happiness is part of how i feel good like i feel proud that willing to take that risk if that makes sense be careful with music powerful i have stuff i listen to because so good at effecting how i feel also your brain releases a lot of chemicals when happy for the first time in a while if ever had an extreme sugar rush or done cocaine lol it can be overwhelming normal though;no
yeah really i was looking into how much of my sleeping pill id need to take to overdose and it turns out id need 300 of them for a lethal dose;no
im sorry to hear how youre feeling right now and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent and everything will hopefully make sense all i can really say right now is to strive on do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved i wish you a wonderful future op and hope that one day everything will be better;strong
i feel the exact same way as you do and im tell my self that im fine if ever want to talk about pm i feel when you talk about your lonliness it helps to get through i use discord and whatsapp if thats your thing dont be to hard on yourself everyone in the world is loved by someone;weak
i get where you are coming from i dont feel cold i feel hollow and my insides are black;no
it definitely is the small things sometimes way to go;no
everything is pointless and hopeless i was born broken and forever unable to feel happiness please end me now i cant do this anymore i had to let that out sorry i hope you find meaning in your days op ive given up myself but i really really hate to see other people feel this way life is so hard i things get better and easier for you;weak
i know i dont get it either if most people were anything like me human civilization would crumble  would never have started;no
i suppose it depends on how deep the pattern is something that help some people is to use a calendar and write down things to do during which hours everyday in advance and try to force yourself to not break the schedule doesnt work for me but i know that it works for some people the most important part id say is to find a goal to strive towards;no
im sorry youre feeling like that i know it sounds grim as fuck but if you broke the record for suicidal thoughts it also means youve broken the record for resisting suicidal thoughts and thats something to be proud of  even if it doesnt feel like it just now;strong
we all are and thats ok;weak
im sorry i wish i could help i feel the same way;strong
hey i think for the upside of it your coworkers are genuinely concern for your wellbeing which is nice and if youre doing a great job at your work then theres still chances of promoting taking care of yourself comes first always;no
life isnt about anything or maybe it is but i think what makes it meaningful are the little moments the little things like a cup of tea on a chilly day petting your dog while lying in a soft bed this sort of stuff unfortunately they dont make the hardships and the sadness any easier;no
maybe it would exhaust them more over time but the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt they may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves they will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life talk with your family work through it together accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you it will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier;weak
hug i cant remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either i need a hug or a cuddle so bad the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me i feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time i dont know how long i can go on best of luck;strong
i support and am thankful for you friend;weak
very sorry to hear it she came back the first time;strong
hey guys another one of you guys here lets all vent to each other lets spit some emotions out i feel hopeless helpless alone empty;no
what responsibility why is that a responsibility did someone give it to you;no
do you mean your bad days feel worse or do you mean you feel bad and good at the same time ever since this thing started for me i had fluctuations over the course of the day days and weeks where i would have lethargy tiredness and depression in the mornings for example and then good feelings and even excitement and a lot of energy in the evenings also i have very good days weeks and suddenly it hits me again did you have constant depression and how bad was it;no
i dont wanna get up at all either but i have a stupid appointment to go to;no
lets start from the beginning is there anything triggering this currently that you can think of how long have you felt this way;no
its normal dont worry too much about it;weak
hey ive been feeling pretty lonely and down myself love the name by the way;no
sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out it lets you feel powerful in control of things in therapy they teach you to sitdown often and sort through your emotions what emotion are you experiencing right now how do you identify it what caused you to feel like this what steps can you make to prevent this feeling try to walk yourself through some of these exercises they might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future;strong
same well obviosuly i dont know how you feel 100 but i thinks its appropiate to say i can relate to you deeply why dont we try distract ourselves even if its just 5 mins listen to a song you like watch a small video browse reyebleach or even go drink water im gonna try and watch something in youtube to at least try and not think about you know what wannna try with me ;weak
i feel the same and i think its because i have nobody to talk to nobody to be vulnerable to and let them know how i feel inside why dont you try to talk to your girlfriend i bet if shed new shed try to help open up to her hope it goes well ;weak
you writing this amp still being here i think thats a good signi think it means that deep down theres still hope that things will get better amp youll start feeling happier amp less lonely hold on to that feeling amp if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me;weak
i wanna be lonely with you guys to heres one big lonely hug  squeeze hard might be the only one you get im alone by myself oh so lonely just want to feel close to another like myself im blown away by the shear lone that has overcome me will i ever break the chains that imprisoned me to lonliness am i to endure this for the rest of my life;strong
yeah man i can relate especially with the crying and screaming thing i wonder whats stopping us from crying and whats worse is ive even had friends comment on how i dont get upset easily or mad about certain things that are usually normal to be mad about but how can i if i dont even feel like im a real human being yah know i wish we could escape the void inside ourselves;weak
im not very happy but i distract myself with hobbies and projects im just used to being single;no
at the last minutes i kinda regret it especially if i had to fall asleep while its the dawn i hate dawn i have noticed that i sleep much better during the day i even fall asleep easily during a day even if i keep the normal mode of awakesleeping;no
my boyfriend and i officially broke up yesterday the pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak when we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners and as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon i am not sure why you two broke up and i know it hurts extremely bad and life has lost much of its meaning i will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly this will be tough this will hurt and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for but i must tell you this feeling is temporary it will not last forever how long it will last i cannot say when it will end i cannot say either but take it one day at a time do things that are only necessary for your existence and those that are extra if you are not up to it do it within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts beat yourself up about them when the time is right started to fix those things and if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so but you as a person have to stand alone so if or when this may happen it will not shake your entire life become strong from this;weak
i hate halloween because im not so fucking fascinated with pop culture im a miserable pretentious douchebag this big deal halloween party i didnt go to this year is just a bunch of cosplayers walking around in a warehouse going oh what are you cooool great job and then awkwardly moving on because you dont actually know anyone just these alienated masks colors and bodies;no
then makes some and create your own future not the one you think people expect of you;no
at some level i still think it is a choice a million different choices for me at least on my bad daysweeksmonthsyears i am so paralyzed by anxiety and depression and apathy for living that i sleep all day and avoid everything i avoid life i want do die but am too lazy to do anything about it when i take initiative to do things work on a project clean stuff i feel so much better i loose myself in my task and all those heavy feelings of hopelessness stay away for awhile maybe it is just me maybe i am just lazy idk but that is my life experience;no
so sorry for your loss;strong
i feel that way but somehow i always manage to lose even more if someone insults me so clearly ive got some buried somewhere i wish i could just have no selfesteem so that i could get that insult immunity but nope whenever i think im out i find more to lose;weak
rather than seeing an entire population you are seeing a narrowed down group based upon one specific topic it may seem hat there are a lot of relationship and family conflicts posted about here because those are large factors in depression there is no one cause to depression it stems from a multitude of factors both biological and environmental past and present experiences genetics predesposed vulnerabilities social connections all play a role;no
so sorry that you are going through this as well is there anyone you might be able to talk with i know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home i know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit i wish i knew something that you could do while at work but i sorry if you want to talk feel free to pm me also at work with the same thoughts;strong
holy shit i can relate so well to this;strong
this stuff all exists on a spectrum so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems ive had hardcore depression for many years but i have definitely moved the bar significantly without meds and without getting what i want in life or something like a great relationship which i can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity i see depression speaking only for myself here as a product of thoughts and meanings the same thing can happen to two people and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one to me growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning and the impersonal nature of thought and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with even arbitrarily so i arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good because it gives me good reference experiences rather than as evidence that i am worthless things like that i still struggle a lot but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues meditation is the single most powerful tool ive found;no
yeah this feeling is a strong one felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood the truth is that i never dealt with it constructively or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling part of the reason i think you and i are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively in my case i used constant denial and selfnumbing  at some point i just assumed the pit was a part of me i could choose to ignore you seem to be actively trying to experience it you are engaging your sadness which is objectively good for working through depression it may not be what you might call conventional but everyone does their thing a little differently  if what you are doing no longer works for you though it might be best to start looking for other healthy ways of working through that discomfort personally when i feel that pit i know what thoughts tend to follow it fortunately my therapists and my stay at hospital helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard in order to redirect those thoughts that create it i try to reach out to anyone in my support net its hard because i feel like they wont give a shit but most of the time they do but i often choose to ignore that reality or i will simply write some positive words here on this reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others but for my own sake as well as you put so well giving that pit a purpose but dont cover that feeling up continue to engage with it as best as you can its there for a reason hopefully the more you work with it the easier it is to process and let go;weak
only you can answer the question i personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life though i agree that the hamster wheel and ratrace pretty sucks but i just dont see much alternative at this point if i want to keep doing what i do now;weak
yes right so my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me i will be better once through it so the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time see to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical take some time out and just breathe and let the shit goyou got this you are right nowliterally and i want to fall into those emotions and spread the way i feel everywhere i want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way but we because we have been here before and got through itand we were happy againand bam we are here now but we will be happy again you know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lollike for real that is the break throughrealizing that it fucking sucks sometimes so what supposed toobecause that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha i hope you feel better all i wish for you;weak
what do you enjoy doing in your free time sitting around being depressed doesnt make for good storytelling at least it didnt for me also please dont apologize we absolutely want to hear how youre feeling on this sub and its beneficial to see and hear other peoples perspectives going through this hell;weak
i hear you so well and im so sorry you feel that way i left my difficulttogetinto art school because of this and my classmates treated it like high school and were jerks but thats irrelevant its not easy;strong
no you are not a loser in any way admiring your depression shows how strong you are this is something that is hard to get rid of believe me i know important is that you give up and keep moving forward a strong and special person i believe in you have hope hug;weak
im sorry you feel like this my daughter has tried to kill herself 3 times and i pretty much have been mentally preparing myself for the worst for the last 6 months bc she was so so depressed and non responsive to meds therapy etc then the craziest thing happenedshe got involved in an old hobby met new people she had stuff in common with and just 5 minutes ago told me that she is going out to lunch with someone from that group my point isthings can change i hope things can change for you soon;strong
hug i cant remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either i need a hug or a cuddle so bad the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me i feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time i dont know how long i can go on best of luck;strong

im sorry your situation at home is so difficult do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how youre feeling;strong
im on mirtazapine at the moment and i too am having issues dealing with the fatigue i spoke to my psychiatrist about it and they said that mirtazapine stimulates both an antihistamine effect and a noroadrenaline effect the antihistamine effect causing the fatigue however once you start taking 30mg daily the noroadrenaline effect outweighs the antihistamine effect and you should feel a lot less fatigue;no
i feel you im in the same situation my depression and anxiety is just good enough for me to be in uni or work but never good enough for me to keep the job or do good in school;no
i hate when people say things like that why on earth would i choose to feel this way;no
i am guilty that i just want to find my own night but all i can say is i hope you make it through one more night i dont know why i wish the utmost pain and death on myself but i pray that others survive depression truly kills ones sanity and mind;weak
i feel you there and i am so sorry those people suck;strong
maybe because the devil you know is better then the one you dont i would say maybe youre afraid of what may happen so much that you would rather endure what you have rather than gamble any of this sound right what bad situation are you in would you like to talk im here if you do  pm or reply on here ;weak
move to australia winter there;no
please dont its just not right choice make there is always something that can be done other than that;strong

i feel ya hope that youll get through this moment in time;weak
i love you all genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone your kindness is beautiful;strong
yeah i resonate with a lot of what youre saying its only on a place like here or a depression support group that you would find others that feel this way let me ask you this what do you find joy or distraction in tell me everything you have tried;weak
i feel that way often when i go out by myself without my husband or mom with me so youre not alone my fear is a combination of the shit my parents told me as a kid and my obsession with crime television its a good day when i can go out by myself and be calm;no
hi i hope you are doing okay today if you have never scene anyone i would recommend a therapist like a lcsw licensed social worker in my experience the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider so i over think it too hard instead put that energy towards finding the right person which means calling lots of places talking to a lot of people and listening to your gut have a good one;weak
just be ur self be true to who u r and wear what u want to wear compare ur self to others because u will loose and forget who u r ur life so live life to the best of ur ability and worry about what anyone else thinks be ur self because u r the only u;weak
same  but like 5050 chance caffeine will make me awake and motivated or panicked and anxious;no

i remember at 89 years old getting scolded for forgetting to brush my teeth and in the morning thereafter i started thinking about how much adults have to remember how much they have to do in their lives if i couldnt remember to brush my teeth every day and i really kept trying how would i remember to do anything else how would i remember to learn be good at school how would i remember to do all the other things i kept forgetting how could i be anything more than terrible like i seemed to keep being even when i succeeded why did i always feel like i was so useless and bad at everything the moment i didnt why did it seem to keep getting worse it was such a tiny thing so inconsequential a moment but a demon was born in my mind that day hes lived there ever since;no
what is something you can do that would feel healthy and bring you a sense of hope do you have a loving friend to reach out to do you have a pet you may be able to hang out with a faith group that brings you peace whats one thing you could do right now that would feel like a healthy step and would bring you some positive vibes;no

as a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there it is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college i know what youre feeling well actually mine was worse since i had little friends but if i could back and give myself advice id tell myself to man up and do well work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now please believe in yourself and press forward although you have all the time in the world to make changes waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression its a problem you dont want to deal with when your older its best done in the present;weak
i understand your pain a lot as i am in a similar position dont bother for anyone but yourself focus on you you and only you forget about those who bring negativity to you;weak

ive read that the minimum lethal dose of hydroxyzine is 1650 mg but that is impossible to calculate correctly because of body weight differences in absorption etc with luvox full recovery with minimal effects has been noted at overdoses of up to 9 grams you might be successful especially if you are small and dont weigh much but there is a not insignificant chance you might end up alive and brain damaged instead i know im a stranger but i am sorry about whatever has brought you to this point do consider trying to get help  even if you have before think about it one last time;strong
you are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and i think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings im sorry i couldnt help more and hope you get better;strong

how did the trauma come about;no
it could be fatigue it could be avoiding the anxietyresponsibility of dealing with others which is the case with me;no

you are in no way the odd man out never once spoken to someone who have something that they worry about whether grades or work or their looks or their friends or personal achievements or their health or even something they said 5 years ago and still feel bad about everyone worries about something and you or i are no exception everyone has two sides the external self which they show to the world and the internal self which they hide all you are seeing is what they want you to see their happiness and confidence and success what they hide are their fears their worries their guilt and even their unrealistic dreams it may seem like the outsider looking in but i promise you that what you are feeling is very ordinary and natural you are not alone;weak
sometimes having friends isnt about them liking you but rather that you like things that other people do like if you are really into something say cars than if you have a car and go to car meets or race others will see this and know that youre the guy to know if they want to get into a car scene another example would be if you are really into books and people feel like reading something and know that you are into books they might come to you for recommendations most friends bond over a subject before they ever get to know each other as anything more than people interested in the same thing;no
i feel you man i attempted suicide 3 times last year because i see the future really getting better no matter how hard i try why i hate when people say gets better not because a raging pessimist i hope this makes you feel at least a little better;weak

that solves nothing and will hurt your loved ones to no end the road to recovery takes a long time and is so much hard work but when you get there everything will change seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step the second step is finding something anything to get out of bed for for me it was my cat i would go without eating for days because i didnt want to leave my house and i didnt want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself when my cat ran out of food i would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldnt be hungry when he curled up with me i felt good at a time that nothing else felt good he passed a few months ago but he flat out saved my life and im constantly grateful life can be overwhelming especially when you feel the way you do but you can make it better dont be afraid to ask for help;weak

i know what you mean ive put off going to the doctors for about a year so far partly because of this i think its healthier to contextualise it like this is my emotional state effecting my quality of life do i constantly put myself down and have low confidence comparing yourself to others is a race to the bottom somebody is always worse off in your eyes because you dont value yourself as much as you do other people your mind down plays your own successes and overplays others the hard bit is convincing yourself that is the case fuck even im not convinced and i have some self awareness of why i feel the way i do its hard man your feelings are real and you dont need to prove otherwise to anybody but yourself;weak

cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly please use a sterile blade if youre going to cut yourself and dont go any deeper than just the surface skin take it from me as someone who has used selfharm an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief i also recommend other methods there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far far safer than cutting are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water boiling water shouldnt be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds on the other end of the scale i found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as i could helped i thought it would just make my hand feel numb but it creates a localised sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me;no

i was diagnosed with it when i was 15 and i am 22 now for my antidepressant i tried lexapro  which i stopped taking because it made my dick stop working and wellbutrin which was alright my antipsychotic was risperidone which i honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day ill be honest i took those combination of drugs for like 25 years and just stopped i learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than i did from years prior looking back thst couldve gone poorly id recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood there are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you dont be afraid of them changing your meds they arent work anyway so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body id also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms the triggers for those symptoms and look to grow from them even while on these medications keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects a lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work ill be honest i did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them i got tired of taking medicine at that point because i had been taking it all my life whether it was for childhood epilepsy adhd depression and the last diagnosis cyclothymia was hospitalized twice before i got the cyclothymia diagnosis and it was pretty bad at one point and looking back im really lucky i didnt mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can do all you can do to find the proper treatment and you will be okay you are not;weak

sorry to hear that obviously a very painful experience of course youre not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person but to get through this life youll really want to get to the place where you understand other peoples behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you im not trying to suggest some stupid mindtrick here of course when someone chooses another person over you you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity but even if someone you are with realizes theyd rather be with someone else it doesnt require them to cheat on you they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someones back human love is fickle theres no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever but it certainly doesnt mean they have to cheat and lie this advice has stuck with me ever since i heard it on a podcast dont ever expect other human beings to be rational or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are they lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever you cant blame yourself for other people otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you and youll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person regardless it isnt exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away but try to love yourself and work on coming around to that understanding that other peoples choices do not say anything about you only about them this action means that they are a cheater not that you are worthless;strong

thought i should write something since the posts you were getting didnt look helpful it is hard not to kick yourself when you feel that you never took a chance to be with someone you thought was the one especially when you consider them to be such a great person i mean how can people not blame it all oneself if the other person is what we see as nothing but good it is points in our life like these that we carry with us that tend to weigh us down in life these moments of regret that can build up over time that we cant move forward;no

dude this feeling i know it and sadly this is a common goto response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute its out of context and beside the point in essence its a variation of the ever popular at least you arent a starving kid in insert country here and more generally it could be worse like yes thanks very much captain obvious everything is relative but thats beside the point its invalidating insensitive and snobby at best and i have no idea if it helps you feel any better but when a lot of people say it they do think theyre doing some genuine good to help you feel better despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is my boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after years of explaining why this is not a good response hes slowly using it less but when it pops up my typical counter is that does not help memake me feel better at all and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said in any case im sorry you had that shitty nonreason response thrown at you what youre going through is real and valid even if others choose not to acknowledge it;strong

my word of advice is just be careful if you genuinely feel like you can make it work again then go for it but if theres that doubt or feeling that youre going to get hurt again it might be best to step away sometimes you can get back with an ex and it all goes well but when it doesnt they can get in your head lay their eggs and just dominate every moment of thought look at your options and determine what the best result will be for yourself;no

why the heck do we hate ourselves man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else sorry to get weird there it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves anyway i have one scar on my arm from one time that i tried that and there forever it still makes me sad when i see it so sorry for what pain you are in there will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself amp the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face;strong

sadness is not the same as depression and people trip all the time and others laugh its no big deal and no one cares beyond that moment next time either make a comment about your legs not working or bow to everyone or something like that or just get on the bus and keep going with your day imagine if you were a waiter and dropped some glasses would you walk right out of the restaurant because people clapped;weak

im so sorry to hear about your situationthats a really difficult thing to have to endure especially with your familys lack of understanding i dont think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your paineven if there is not a reliable treatment now pain relief is a major area of medical science research is medical marijuana legal where you live or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is you might find support and recommendations at rsciatica hang in there i would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if thats an option otherwise it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity paid or unpaid that is meaningful to you if movement is an issue look up online opportunities which will help you get your mind off of your pain;strong

that whole best years of your life thing at least in my opinion is a load of hogwash best years body going through changes trying to figure out your first relationships stuck in school all day drama everywhere restricted in everything you want to do inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do i could go on hs sucks with very few exceptions the only people i know who consider hs the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rosecolored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything college is better for most people but the partying and crap is highly overrated once youre old enough to look back a bit i dont know anyone who misses that stuff but what are the best years i think once you hit your mid20s things really start to look up odds are your career is at least starting to actually materialize you arent as emotionally immature anymore and things dont bother you like they used to and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall dont sell your future shortyoull look back and realize theres a lot of crap in hscollege that youll be glad to have behind you;weak
theres no better person to tell someone something than a nurturing mother they typically love you unconditionally friends and significant others get a scent of the depression on you and they distance themselves as it becomes a deeper problem as opposed to helping if your mother loves you she will understand and its not like you are admitting you have gay sex or addictions to banging drugs up your arm or killed someone this is not to be insensitive remotely benign to say to your family they might be able to recommend something that helps;weak
i know how it feels man it sucks terrible to hear and sorry ;weak
omg lol i 100 blame my parents after taking an ap psychology course at my school it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression i know i cant claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents the genetic aspects arent their fault of course but they are perfect human specimens so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process strangely being cognizant of that fact doesnt change it much of course ive directly told my parents i blame them for who i am and as perfect specimens they told me that i cant keep blaming them for everything theres truth to that of course but its rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility id better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim since theyre the ones who work and pay for my existence regardless of whether or not i can actually do jack shit about that child labor laws yo lol sorry your post is just so relatable i had to rant;strong
hey sorry that you had to deal with that those dreams that you discern from reality are the worst is this something that you frequently deal with;strong

that someone will come into your life when you least expect it i want to kill your hopes by saying that they cure your depression because they very well could but they also may not i will say that having someone you love and someone who loves you does help but remember that you have to put so much effort into looking for someone because the right person will show up without you having to try so hard beat yourself up if you have anyone yet it takes time of course focus on yourself and doing things that you enjoy things that help pull you away from depressive thoughts get through this;no

tbh i used to hate being sensitive but i love it now and people need to be considerate of it really a strength being sensitive makes your more empathetic which is an amazing fucking quality to have and just really more in tune with the mood of the room do you know there are some people that just babble on and even ever tell that other stopped listening i know it sucks overthinking and constantly worrying but being sensitive makes you a better human;no
