Passive,8,4,5,5,4,4,5,5,"1. Nice UI 2. Good user experience 3. The empathetic way of speaking to the chatbot, just like the human beings",1. more topics to cover besides the childhood issue
Detractor,6,5,4,3,5,3,4,5,"Answer is quick and polite
","Not many messages one time
"
Passive,7,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,It is positive and supportive.,Maybe the conversations could be a bit briefer so the vital information can be more prominent.
Passive,8,4,4,5,3,4,5,5,,The responses are sometimes slow
Passive,7,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,Give me some suggestion to cope with negative emotion.,"More detailed suggestions can be presented in the dialogue interface instead of using code names, it's unconvenient to find information in protocal viewer"
Promoter,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Responsiveness,
Passive,7,4,5,4,3,4,4,5,"It’s interactive, and engaging",Maybe shorter sentences? Fix the “replay” button 
Passive,8,5,4,4,3,4,5,5,The chatbot talks in a polite manner and provides me with useful protocol even though the chatbot cannot determine my feeling or reason.,"1. Maybe use expressions during the chat to make the conversation more lively and realistic.
2. Provide the link to the protocol. It's difficult for me to locate the protocol precisely for the first time.
3. Sometimes the chatbot cannot respond immediately. There is some delay."
Passive,7,4,3,5,5,3,4,3,"Flexibility is given to change the flow of the conversation.
The conversation is served with psychological knowledge that potentially helps user.",Some questions during the conversation may be a bit ambiguous. (e.g. answers Yes/No are sometimes not clear in which direction it goes).
Passive,7,5,3,4,5,3,4,4,"The conversation is nice, feels like talking to a nice friendly person.",More choices for conversation or allow user to input custom content. Use examples when explaining emotions or how to deal with it.

Promoter,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"It is very friendly, consideration and helpful","Add a back button, if user would like to modify their previous "

Passive,7,5,3,5,5,3,3,4,"quite interesting project, it should help a person does self-psychotherapy","'- zoom in/out in the right window, text is too small
- self-defense explanations should have examples to make it easier to understand, I found it's quite hard to comprehend in some parts because it has many technical (psychological) terms."
Passive,7,4,3,5,3,4,4,4,The chatbot was very empathetic! And i liked how there were areas where I can include open texts (eg. giving the name of the person i was feeling negative towards). ,"The chatbot generally gauged my emotions correctly, but could not deal with tricky text (eg. it guessed that I was sad when i told it i felt 'not bad'). It would also be great to have the chatbot to be more interactive (eg. show me the protocol when i decide what protocols to use). "
Promoter,10,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,I like the utterances are very empathetic.,briliant job!
Promoter,9,5,5,4,3,4,5,4,I have learnt much more about handling my emotional state and that how to better recognize my defense mechanism. It truly is one novel method to relearn about myself.,The front-end can be designed to better improve the engagement.
Passive,8,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,It talks gently,It can give more choices for us
Detractor,5,4,3,3,5,2,2,3,"It response qickly and efficiency, and it is easy to talk with them just by select answers.","I think the settings of the question are straightforward, and there are too few of them, that they cannot fit my actual situation well. So I can't solve my emotional problem through this program. I hope you can set more questions and provide us with more options."
Promoter,10,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,"The interface is user-friendly, and the chatbot is very helpful in making me recognise my flaws. ",Give more options to the user to use as a response.
Passive,8,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,Plenty of useful suggestions for overcoming negative emotions,"I think this chatbot is meant to talk about negative emotions in one's childhood so I don't see the meaning of asking about feelings in recent days. In my expectation, if you recognise the negative emotions of the recent days, it might be better to give suggestions first and make sure the participant is feeling better before you go through the next question (negative emotions in childhood)."
Passive,8,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,I enjoyed the quick responses that were primarily accurate. I felt the chatbot had good intentions and could pick up knowledge quickly.,"Add a spectrum of confidence in the chatbot's knowledge. If there it's not sure what the user is going through, then map the confidences to responses so the user can get a better understanding of the logic of the chatbot. Perhaps then you could have a tree of responses for the user to help the bot in different situations."
Promoter,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,,
Passive,7,4,3,2,4,4,4,4,,Increase the number of questions and options
Promoter,9,4,4,4,5,3,4,5,It responds quickly. The QA setting so make sense.,"If the protocol can automatically reply in the chatbox, it may be better for users to interact with the bot."
Promoter,9,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,"The questions it asks me step by step become deeper as they progress, which makes it easy for me to take the advice it gives.",It felt a little abrupt to me that the conversation ended soon after the chatbot suggested the protocol at the end.
Passive,8,5,5,5,5,4,3,3,What I like most about this app is its quick response.,Dialogue skills need to be improved.
Passive,7,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,,
Passive,7,5,3,4,4,4,3,4,"Helpful to format, with the descriptions on the right side.

The chatbot felt personal","Providing it with a bigger vocabulary of emotions. It reduced a lot to ""happy""

Would be helpful if it broke down the protocols into more granular tasks "
Passive,8,3,5,3,5,4,3,4,"The web interface is clear. Very minimalistic and high quality communication experience, have noticed that persona uses a letter A. Based on my experience, this may be more inviting to confide with a chatbot than facing a portrait.","As a chatbot to detect the defence mechanism has been very qualified, further improvement may be a bit general when recommending the SAT protocols."
Passive,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,It speaks like a human,no suggestions
Passive,8,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,"References to the protocols are useful.
The rational approach to tackle emotion works.",System asks how I am feeling. I say: fine. System says I get a feeling you are angry today! Please correct me if I am wrong! - Sounds a bit obvious that the system is playing it safe in this mechanical response!
