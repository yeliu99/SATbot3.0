Passive,7,4,3,4,5,3,4,5,"The idea of recognising your defense mechanisms is attractive!  The chatbot runs smoothly and at a good pace.  The repetitive positive responses reduces the impact on compassion it means to convey.

Also the suggested protocols are theoretically comprehensible but not easy to practice.",As above.
Detractor,6,3,3,3,4,2,3,3,"These bots overall are getting better: more human, more intuitive.","Improve:
Binary interpretation - e.g. better than yesterday -> ‘so you’re happy?’, e.g. ‘Yes, I’d love to’ and ’No, I’d like to end the session’ as options
Big chunks of text - e.g. 7 messages at once = overload
Poor flow at points - e.g. ‘I am sorry to bother you’ (when we are mid conversation); e.g. ‘have you gone through protocol 9’ when we are 2 minutes into meeting!
Impersonal at points - e.g. ‘have you gone through protocol 9’ -> e.g. ‘the sadness protocol’
Doesn’t run me through the protocol but expects me to navigate to, read and process a dense text file"
Passive,7,5,4,4,5,3,2,3,It was very empathic and asked good questions. ,"Although there were suitable questions, they were not enough to identify the defense mechanisms used by the participant. In fact, the suggestive defense mechanism by the chatbot needs to be based on more specific detailed questions while interacting with the participant. Moreover, more similar situations in the participant's life can be used in this respect.   "
